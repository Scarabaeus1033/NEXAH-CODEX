# 🔤 Codex Pulse Symbols

This file documents the **symbolic field logic** behind the pulse transitions and alignments within the *Einstein–Neptune–Mercury Field* module. It connects **glyphs**, **formula morphisms**, and **field functions** across resonance zones.

## 📐 Example Glyph Transitions

```text
𝔼 = m·c² ⇝ pulse(ψₙ) ⇝ µ_m · ∇Φ ⇝ 𝓜(Ar)
```

This sequence expresses the symbolic transformation from mass-energy into memory-mirrored glyphs across resonance fields.

```text
Ωₓ → ⧖ → ⟁ → ℘
```

Represents temporal loop modulation through Möbius transfer and resonance cycle.

## 📎 Codex Applications

These symbols are used:

- In `pulse_axis_derivation.md` as logical field morphisms
- In upcoming visual legends (`X_DIMENSIONAL_PULSE_MAP.png`, `GAS_PENTAGRAM_QUINTESSENCE.png`)
- In experimental mapping of Arrokoth–ULLINIUM transition logic

→ Next: `pulsefield_coordinates.md`
