# 🪞 Arrokoth Mirror Notes

## 🌌 Role of Arrokoth in Codex Cosmology

Arrokoth, as a **trans-Neptunian object** beyond Pluto, serves in the Codex as a **symbolic mirror anchor** — not only astronomically distant, but **resonantly deep**.

- Positioned at the **outermost pulse terminus**
- Encodes **memory, reflection, and transition**
- Acts as **echo node** for incoming wavefronts

This makes Arrokoth a **memory capsule** for the Einstein–Pulse–Neptune–Mercury field.

## 🌀 Mirror Logic in the Pulse System

Arrokoth reflects and finalizes:

1. **Gaseous signal from Neptune** (breath modulation)
2. **Teardrop resonance from Mercury** (curvature compression)
3. **Energy seed from Einstein origin** (scalar pulse)

Thus:

```text
Einstein ⟶ Neptune ⟶ Mercury ⟶ Arrokoth
         ↘︎          ↘︎           ↘︎
          [ Cascade Pulse Memory Field ]
```

The **mirror is non-linear**: not reflection in space, but in **resonant field inversion**.

## 🛰 Symbolic Coordinate Interpretation

| Role       | Symbolic Coordinate        | Description                          |
|------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Arrokoth   | (–Φ, –π, –√2)              | Inverted echo chamber                |
| Function   | Memory field / pulse sink | Terminal receiver and field memory   |
| Dynamics   | Möbius mirror overlay      | Nonlocal reflective modulation logic |

## 🧬 Resonant Function of Arrokoth

- Preserves **Codex field states** at edge boundaries
- Integrates **ULLINIUM echo** via Möbius transfer logic
- Holds **resonant imprint** of the entire axis pulse
- Becomes **anchor point** for `ARROKOTH_CODEX`
