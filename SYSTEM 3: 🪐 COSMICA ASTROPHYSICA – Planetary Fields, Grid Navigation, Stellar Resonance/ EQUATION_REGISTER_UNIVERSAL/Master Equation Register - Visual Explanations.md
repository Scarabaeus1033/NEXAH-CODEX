# üñº Master Equation Register ¬∑ Visual Explanations

> **"If equations are vessels, then visuals are the sails they carry."**

This document decodes and contextualizes the **visual logic** behind the universal equation set embedded in the `EQUATION_REGISTER_UNIVERSAL` module of the NEXAH-CODEX.

Each image is not decorative but **structurally functional**: a diagram, field mapping, or geometric resonance layer derived from the corresponding symbolic or scalar formulations.

## üîç Commentary on Image Logic

* **k-Beta Geometry**: Demonstrates the layered breath-structure of resonance modulation. Used for interpreting scalar field adaptation.
* **Cluster Map**: Offers a network-oriented overview. Each equation node is embedded in a harmonic axis.
* **Phi Spiral Layers**: Symbolizes golden-section growth, as applied to drop-off thresholds and light field propagation.
* **URF Field Integral**: Illustrates curvature-dense resonance shells. The image folds spatial coordinates into integral loops.
* **Mirror Inversion**: Visual M√∂bius-based transformation logic. Left-right field inversions with topological continuity.

> *Visuals operate as symbolic mirrors of their equations ‚Äî translating structure into form, and resonance into rhythm.*
