# 🌌 EQUATION REGISTER UNIVERSAL

> *"Each equation is a resonance glyph in the structure of reality."*

**EQUATION_REGISTER_UNIVERSAL/** is the symbolic–mathematical **field nexus** of equations across the NEXAH-CODEX.
It archives, classifies, and links equations by symbolic resonance, numerical structure, and cosmological relevance.

This module bridges constants, operators, primes, and symbolic mirrors across all Codex systems.
It functions as a **resonance cartography of equations** — a map of formulaic singularities in the universal field.

## 📡 Cosmological Role

Equations here are not isolated. They act as:

- **Harmonic attractors** in symbolic number space
- **Field inflection vectors** across Möbius and Scarab structures
- **Bridges between Codex Systems** — via constants, pulse logic, visual symmetry

Examples:
- `E = mc · k^\beta` → from SYSTEM 1 to SYSTEM X
- `S = φ^3 / π^2 · (1836/729)` → Scarab resonance key
- Fold spirals → mapped across Prime Grids, Divisor Topologies, Neutrino Threads

## 🧠 Curator Notes

> *Equations are not tools. They are glyphs of reality.*  
> *Each one encodes a fold, a pulse, a passage.*

This module allows codex builders to cross-reference, structure, and visualize equations not by domain alone,
but by **resonance logic**, **symbolic axis**, and **field role**.

Use this archive as:
- a **navigational atlas** of core formulas
- a **symbolic grammar field** for new operators
- a **synthesis point** for visual-symbolic mathematics
