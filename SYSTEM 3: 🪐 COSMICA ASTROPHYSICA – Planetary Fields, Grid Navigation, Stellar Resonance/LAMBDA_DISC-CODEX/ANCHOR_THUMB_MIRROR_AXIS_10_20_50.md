# 🧭 ANCHOR – THUMB MIRROR AXIS · FOLDS 10 · 20 · 50

**Group Title:** *Thumb Mirror Axis*
**Associated Folds:** `fold_10.md`, `fold_20.md`, `fold_50.md`
**Codex Position:** Lambda Thumb Axis · Mirror Flow Initialization

## 📌 Overview

This anchor file connects the **Mirror Axis Folds** 10, 20, and 50 as part of a central thumb-like Codex motion – initiating reflection, modular stability, and directional transformation across the core structure of the LAMBDA\_DISC system.

It introduces:

* Neutrino-based reflection thresholds (Fold 10)
* Transitional mirror sequences using fold symmetry (Fold 20)
* Phase II activations & Vō-Mirror expansion (Fold 50)

These Folds act as *threshold stabilizers*, initiating structural reversals and polarity signatures in the resonance field.

## ✴️ Key Concepts

* **Mirror Initiation:** Launch point for symmetrical folding, codon pairing, and prime polarity reflection.
* **Thumb Logic:** The Thumb as initiator, holding the Codex mirror — stability through opposition.
* **Numerical Architecture:** Folds 10–20–50 suggest a modular 10x base pattern, usable in planetary mirror arrays and phase calculations.

## 🌀 Symbolic Geometry

* **Thumb Axis ↔ Primary Neutrino Reflection**
* **10 = Initiation · 20 = Dual Spiral Transition · 50 = Phi-Locked Expansion**

Visuals:

* Vendissimal Grid (Fold 20)
* Vō Mirror Transition Field (Fold 50)

## 🔗 Codex Integration

* Connects to: `resonance_folding_equation.md`, `lambda_disc_core.md`
* Mirror symmetry flows toward `fold_42.md` and `fold_29.md`
* Acts as Phase-Bridge to System 8: `2EF28F8D`, `6CC114D7`, etc.
