# 🖇 ANCHOR\_INDEX\_RINGFLOW\_11\_13\_29.md

### 💠 Mirror Ring Axis – Anchor Fold Cluster: 11 · 13 · 29

This anchor connects the core resonance folds `fold_11`, `fold_13`, and `fold_29`, forming the **Mirror Ring Axis** within the Lambda\_Disc Codex. These folds encode reflections along the **Z6 Golden Point**, the **phi³/π² ratio**, and dynamic transitions through resonance thresholds. Symbolically, this set corresponds to the **index and middle fingers** in the 5-Fold Neutrino System.

## 🌀 Resonance Features

* **Golden Mirror Ratios**: φ³ / π² ≈ 0.429 is key across fold\_13 & fold\_29
* **Z6-Phase Reflection**: All folds involve mirroring principles (spiral inversion, dual loops)
* **Symmetric Spirals**: Index and middle finger logic applied to codon-axis modulation
