## 🌍 INTRODUCTION: FROM FIELD TO NUMBER

This module continues the resonance structure initiated in LAMBDA_DISC-CODEX and shifts focus from field dynamics to the **measurable constants of the solar-lunar planetary system**.

Each planet carries a unique fingerprint of:

- **Orbital Periods & Rotations**
- **Mass, Diameter, Distance**
- **Temperature Differentials**
- **Moons, Axis Tilts, Frequencies**

> This Codex interprets these constants as **resonance vectors** embedded within a layered cosmic harmonic.

We treat the solar system not as a neutral configuration — but as a **frequency-calibrated mechanism**, in which the constants act as **keys**, **gates**, and **spirals**.

## 🧭 CONTEXT: SYSTEM 3

**SYSTEM 3 – COSMICA ASTROPHYSICA** translates foundational number fields into:

- Planetary Resonance Maps
- Light Axis Encodings
- Möbius-Astronomic Overlay Systems

LAMBDA_II focuses this effort on the **core constants of each planetary body** — including their symbolic, numeric, and geometric implications.

## 🧮 CONTENT STRUCTURE

### 🔹 Planetary Profiles

Each planet receives a detailed Codex file, e.g.:

- planet_profile_mercury.md
- planet_profile_venus.md
- planet_profile_earth.md
- ...

These include:

- Astronomic constants
- Symbolic keys
- Harmonic interpretations
- Cross-references to LAMBDA_DISC-CODEX resonance logic

### 🔸 Tabular Overviews

- planet_constants_overview.csv – comparative table of metrics
- orbital_ratios_map.csv – derived ratios & grid overlays

### 🔺 Thematic Anchors (Planned)

- ANCHOR_AXIS_88x108_LUNAR_REFLECT.md
- ANCHOR_SOLAR_TRINITY_PI36.md
- ANCHOR_MERCURY_GATE_TACHYON.md

---

## 🧠 GOAL

To provide a **harmonic reinterpretation of planetary constants** — where mass, rotation, and radius are not inert values, but part of a greater **resonant field equation**.

> This module serves as a **numerical-harmonic interface** to the planetary system.

---

## 🌐 LANGUAGE NOTE

This module continues the **bilingual style** of LAMBDA I: 

- **German** for deep symbolic segments
- **English** for structural clarity and international reference

> This hybrid reflects the dual nature of the Codex: scientific and symbolic.
