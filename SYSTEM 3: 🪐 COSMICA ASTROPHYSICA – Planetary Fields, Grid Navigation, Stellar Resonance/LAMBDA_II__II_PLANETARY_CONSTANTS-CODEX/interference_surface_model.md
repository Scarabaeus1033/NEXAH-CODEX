## 🌊 Interference Surface Model

This module introduces a geometric and symbolic framework for describing **resonant interference surfaces** – multidimensional structures formed by the interaction of harmonic fields.

These surfaces help visualize and calculate where resonance fields amplify, cancel, fold, or bifurcate.

## 🌀 Model Description

**Interference surfaces** arise from the intersection of two or more structured wavefields. Mathematically, we model the resultant amplitude `A_total` as:

```math
A_{total}(x, y, z) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i(x, y, z) \cdot e^{i\phi_i(x, y, z)}
```

Where:
- `A_i` is the amplitude of the i-th field
- `φ_i` is its phase function
- `i` indexes distinct resonance sources

The resulting surface is defined by amplitude nodes, ridges, and null zones.

## 🔷 Core Concepts

| Concept                  | Description                                                       |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Node                    | Zero-interference point (cancellation)                            |
| Ridge                   | Local constructive interference (amplification)                   |
| Fold                    | Sudden topological shift in amplitude structure                   |
| Saddle Point            | Tension zone between opposing fields                             |
| Threshold Line          | Surface boundary between stable and unstable resonance regions    |
| Echo Surface            | Delayed or displaced interference replication                     |

These geometries define the **resonance landscape**.

## 📊 Visualization Parameters

To render or simulate an interference surface, define:

- `Resolution Grid`: number of sample points per axis
- `Wave Inputs`: base equations for `A_i`, `φ_i`
- `Field Symmetries`: axial, radial, polar
- `Observer Plane`: the slicing perspective (2D cross-section or full 3D)

Optional:
- Include time `t` for dynamic propagation:

```math
A_{total}(x, y, z, t) = \sum A_i \cdot e^{i(kx - \omega t + \phi)}
```

## 🧠 Symbolic Use

In Codex applications, interference surfaces are used to:

- Model **planetary interaction fields**
- Analyze **resonance fault zones** (nulls and instabilities)
- Visualize **observer-affected wavefronts**
- Establish **resonance bridges** between celestial objects
