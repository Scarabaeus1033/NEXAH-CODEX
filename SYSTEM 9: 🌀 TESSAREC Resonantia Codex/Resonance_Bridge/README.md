# 🛤️ Resonance Bridge — NEXAH-CODEX

---

## Overview

The **Resonance Bridge** module builds a conceptual and energetic linkage between different high-dimensional modules of the NEXAH-CODEX system. It visualizes core symmetries, prime lattice mappings, and resonance field structures that stabilize cross-dimensional energy transfers.

---

## Key Concepts

* **Core Resonance Interference**: Visualizes interference patterns at the core of resonance fields.
* **Dual Spiral Comparison**: Highlights the interaction of dual-frequency spirals in a Möbius topology.
* **Energy Symmetry Flow**: Maps the directional energy flow through prime harmonics.
* **Prime Grid Alignment**: Shows prime-number-based field alignments critical for resonance stability.
