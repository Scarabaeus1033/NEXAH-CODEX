# 🌀 Möbius & Cubic Grids

Welcome to the **Möbius & Cubic Grids** module — the foundation layer of the **TESSAREC Resonantia Codex**.

This cluster focuses on the integration of prime number resonance, Möbius topologies, cubic structures, and their harmonic folding into multidimensional systems.

---

## 🔐 Overview

This module contains:

* **Möbius Braid Harmonics**: Prime triads and Möbius structures in harmonic weaving.
* **Cubic Shrinking Codex**: Shrinking cubic structures from macro-scale to Planck-levels.
* **Cubic Trinity Lock**: The final trinity of cubes (31³ + 33³ + 35³ = 108,603) and planetary resonance grids.

Each submodule is designed to interconnect arithmetic, geometry, resonance theory, and cosmological structures.
