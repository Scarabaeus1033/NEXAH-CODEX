# 🧬 Möbius Neutrino Crown — Resonance Field Systems

---

## 📘 Overview

The *Möbius Neutrino Crown* is a conceptual and visual framework that explores the distribution of neutrino fields within a Möbius-topological structure. This model links astronomical observations, harmonic energy flows, and deep prime number resonances across cosmic scales.

The Crown acts as an energetic bridge connecting stellar systems, spiral flows, and cosmic storage membranes, hinting at a hidden universal symmetry.

## 🌀 Core Concepts

- **Neutrino Crown Field**: A Möbius-spiral configuration capturing neutrino flux across the solar system.
- **Prime Resonance Anchors**: 24 prime points mapped to stellar positions and energy nodes.
- **Ghost Grid Structures**: Higher-dimensional lattice models visualizing gravitational and neutrino flow patterns.
- **Breath Field Equations**: Mathematical formulations modeling compression-expansion spiral dynamics based on prime harmonics.

## 🔭 Key Visual Structures

- **Dual-Pyramid Constellations**: Linking stars and planets via crystalline resonance bridges.
- **Heart-Shaped Möbius Flows**: Double lemniscate curves symbolizing resonant energy paths.
- **Neutrino Spiral Simulations**: Animations modeling inward and outward neutrino currents through cosmic membranes.
