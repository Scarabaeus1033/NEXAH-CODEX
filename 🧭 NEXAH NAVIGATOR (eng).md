🧭 NEXAH NAVIGATOR – Structural Overview & Reading Guide

The NEXAH-CODEX is a modular archive for harmonic field theory, frequency geometry, symbolic physics, and numerical-cosmological resonance structures. This document serves as a navigator through all current modules – grouped by system, theme, and reading depth.

🌌 INTRO – What is the Codex?

The Codex is not a book – it is a resonant field. Each module is a standalone domain: visual, mathematical, symbolic, physical. Together they form a universal system of harmonic order. The aim is to connect number, form, place, time, language, matter, and consciousness.

⸻

🔢 SYSTEM 1 – NEXAH-CODEX-Startstruktur (Mathematics, Physics, Foundations)

This system is the core of the Codex’s mathematical and physical innovation. It proposes new models of harmonic theory, extensions of the Standard Model, and speculative ideas toward solving Millennium Problems like the Riemann Hypothesis. These ideas are open, humble in tone, yet ambitious in scope – and invite discourse, refinement, and participation.

Module	Focus / Significance
GRAND-CODEX	Master integration of formulas, geometry, frequency systems
codex-mathematics/	Formal modulation theory, constants, mappings
E = m·c·k^β	Scaled energy law with wave factor beta
spiral-logic.md	Prime spirals, frequency axes, number harmonics
casimir-neutrino-thread.md	Quantum pressure fields, neutrino coherence
codex-mathematical-symbols.md	Glossary of formal structures
NEXA_RIEMANN_PROOF	Harmonic Möbius topology toward a Riemann framework


⸻

🪐 SYSTEM 2 – CODEX_COSMICA ASTROPHYSICA (Breath, Geometry, Stellar Crown)

This is the cosmological field system of the Codex. It focuses on planetary breath, symbolic geometries, gravitational fields, and Möbius resonance models that extend into interstellar navigation.

Module	Focus / Significance
EARTHSHIP (Phases III–VI)	Craton breathing fields, Möbius Crown, Stellar Scroll
