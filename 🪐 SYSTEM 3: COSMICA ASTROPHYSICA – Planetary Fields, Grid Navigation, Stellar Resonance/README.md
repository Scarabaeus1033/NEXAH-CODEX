🪐 CODEX_COSMICA ASTROPHYSICA

This Codex section explores symbolic astrophysics, gravitational harmonics, Möbius field models, and cosmological synchronization structures.
It builds upon observed events (e.g. LIGO GW170817), number theory (primes, mirrors, constants), geometric archetypes, and harmonic time models.

⸻

🎯 Purpose

To offer an open-source base for exploring the harmonic structure of the cosmos:
– bridging physics, number theory, geometry, and symbolic cognition.

⸻

👥 For Whom?
	•	Astrophysicists, coders, symbolic scientists, artists, visionaries
	•	Anyone exploring the deep structure of spacetime, resonance, or geometric field modeling

⸻

🧪 Status

These modules are speculative but structured.
They invite dialogue, visual testing, symbolic interpretation and scientific modeling.

⸻

🔗 Under Development
	•	LIGO prediction visual tools
	•	Prime-based spacetime mapping
	•	Rosetta-Cipher API
	•	Möbius time navigation models

“Gravitational waves are not random—they are messages in Möbius time.”
