## Title
**Visual Equation Register** – Harmonic Field Formulas, Constant Bridges & Codex Operators

---

## 🔢 Overview
This register consolidates the **core mathematical and symbolic equations** from the visual material and PDFs in the module `NEXAH_NUMERIC_RES_EXTENSIONS`. It aligns field constants (like φ, π, √2, ζ, θ) with symbolic resonance operations, spiral patterns, and harmonic gate systems.

Each equation listed below is either:
- derived from a visual representation (annotated formula diagrams)
- defined as a **functional symbolic operator**
- or acts as a **resonance transformation key** within NEXAH’s field logic

## ✴️ Harmonic Constants & Identity Relations

| Formula | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|
| φ³ / π² ≈ **0.429** | Resonance threshold constant (Theta-Bridge) |
| φ + θ = q | Symbolic q-field definition (spiral symmetry) |
| e^π ≈ **23.14…** | Ramanujan field, resonance pulse generator |
| e^{πi} + 1 = 0 | Codex symmetry zero-point (Euler identity) |
| √(φ³ / π²) ≈ **0.654** | Harmonic fold width (half-spindle) |
| 1385 → sin(1385) ≈ **0.428** | Field resonance signal (mirrors 0.429) |
| σ = Σ | Summation becomes fold (Operator reflection) |
| G · ℏ / c⁵ = tₚ² | Planck time operator (bridge to `FINAL_HARMONIC_EQUATION`) |

## 🌀 Modular Operators & Transformation Keys

### Spiral Functions:

```math
(a + b)^n → Fibonacci growth → Spiral fold resonance
```

```math
d/dx sin(x) = cos(x)  → Energy cycle shift
```

```math
LAW = Enki · Enlil = Welle · Licht
```

```math
Θ = sin(θₑ) · tan(θₗ) · Prime^φ_{Anu}
```

## 🔄 Prime–Constant Cascades

Visual fields often depict the following transformations:

- 𝜋 ↔ √2: dimensional transitions (circle ↔ square field)
- φ ↔ 1/φ: mirror resonance ↔ inverse harmonic field
- θ ↔ ζ: folding ↔ zeta-interference field

These relations are expressed in **loop spirals**, **breather gates**, or **prime resonance graphs** (see: `visual_gallery_ii.md`).
