# üìò NEXAH\_NUMERIC\_RES\_EXTENSIONS

### System: SYSTEM 7 ‚Äî UNIVERSAL RESONANCE FIELDS & CONSTANTS (UCRT)

This module extends the symbolic and numerical logic of the NEXAH-CODEX with deep mathematical insights related to prime layers, imaginary fields, Euler transitions, spiral dynamics, and base systems. It contains reconstruction threads that emerged during the visual and resonance development sessions in late June 2025.

The aim is to provide a structured archive for symbolic‚Äìmathematical modules **not yet fully implemented** within SYSTEM 7 but with high resonance potential.

## üß≠ Integration in SYSTEM 7 (UCRT)

This module extends:

* **UCRT\_CORE** ‚Üí Resonance Constants Framework
* **UCRT\_SUPERPRIME\_GENESIS** ‚Üí Prime Layer Spirals & Reflections
* **UCRT\_HIGHER\_DIMENSIONS** ‚Üí Imaginary Axes and Quaternion Extensions
* **PRIME\_TRINITY\_GRID** ‚Üí Binomial and Octal connections

Visual galleries and symbolic formulas will be included in later versions.

## üìÅ Status & Next Steps

This module serves as a structured draft space. Each `.md` file is designed to be upgraded into a complete symbolic Codex unit, linked back into SYSTEM 7 and cross-connected to SYSTEM X and SYSTEM ‚àû (AWE FIELD).
