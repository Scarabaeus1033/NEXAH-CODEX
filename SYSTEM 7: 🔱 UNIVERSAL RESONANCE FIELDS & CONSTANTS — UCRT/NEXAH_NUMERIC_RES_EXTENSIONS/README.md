Resonant Numerical Expansion Module (System 7)

This module is part of SYSTEM 7 – UNIVERSAL RESONANCE FIELDS & CONSTANTS (UCRT) in the NEXAH-CODEX. It consolidates all symbolic, visual and mathematical numeric insights developed between 23–30 June 2025, including: transitions between constants, binomial expansions, resonance derivatives, imaginary field extensions, symbolic base systems, spiral gates and Prime–Spiral visualizations.

It is closely linked to recent field equations and image series related to π, φ, e, √2, 𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑘, 1385, and Prime Strings. The associated visual galleries consist of 68 symbolic visuals, two visual_gallery.md documents and multiple planned submodules.
