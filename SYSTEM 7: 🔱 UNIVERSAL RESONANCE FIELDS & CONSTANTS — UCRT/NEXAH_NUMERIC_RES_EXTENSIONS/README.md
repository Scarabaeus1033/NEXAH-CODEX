## Resonant Numerical Expansion Module *(System 7)*

This module is part of **SYSTEM 7 – UNIVERSAL RESONANCE FIELDS & CONSTANTS (UCRT)** within the NEXAH-CODEX. It consolidates symbolic, visual, and mathematical numeric insights developed between **23–30 June 2025**, including:

* transitions between constants,
* binomial expansions,
* resonance derivatives,
* imaginary field extensions,
* symbolic base systems,
* spiral gates,
* and prime-resonance visualizations.

It is closely linked to recent field equations and image series related to π, φ, *e*, √2, *i*, *j*, *k*, **1385**, and **Prime Strings**. The associated visual galleries consist of **68 symbolic visuals**, two `visual_gallery.md` documents, and multiple themed submodules.
