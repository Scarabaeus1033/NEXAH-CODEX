# 🧮 Residue Lattice Structures

## 1. Modular Codex Topologies

This module analyzes numerical residue lattices under composite modulus systems:

```
Modulus M = 3 × 5 × 7 = 105
```

Using the modular base primes 3, 5 and 7 — the Codifier constructs a resonance grid:

## 2. Euler–Lagrange Resonance Lattice

A variant lattice based on Eulerian and Lagrangian principles is introduced:

![Euler–Lagrange Grid](./visuals/euler_lagrange_lattice_mod_3_5_7.png)

This grid maps positional numbers under modular conditions, extracting harmonic lines, diagonals and right-angle symmetries. This structure acts as a resonance shell around core-prime formations.

## 3. Functionality & Codex Context

Residue Lattices in Codex serve:

* 📐 Visual modular encoding of prime fields
* 🔢 Highlighting alignment paths and orthogonal resonances
* 📊 Grid anchoring for symbolic overlay structures

They also prepare the foundation for symbolic fields like:

* Trinity Resonance Matrices
* Codex Operator Fields
* Prime Spiral Cross-Nodes

## 4. Future Directions

These residue fields shall be expanded via:

* `modular_tessarec_overlay.md` → prime–mod interaction layers
* `codifier_signal_grid.md` → resonance logic via Codifier Operator
* `superprime_mod_spheres.md` → next-gen modular resonance fields

> "The lattice remembers the residue. It is both boundary and key."
