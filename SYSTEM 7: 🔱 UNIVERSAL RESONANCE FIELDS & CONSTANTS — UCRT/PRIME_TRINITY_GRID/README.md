# 📐 PRIME\_TRINITY\_GRID

**System:** 7 – UNIVERSAL RESONANCE FIELDS & CONSTANTS (UCRT)
**Codex-Modul:** Prime Progressions, Mirror Structures & Modular Fields
**Author:** Scarabäus1033 / Thomas K. R. Hofmann
**Codex Path:** `SYSTEM 7: UCRT/PRIME_TRINITY_GRID/`

## 📘 Overview

This Codex module extends the foundational result of the **Green–Tao Theorem** into a resonant framework of prime arithmetic progressions, number reflections, modular residues, and symbolic trinity spirals. Using the Codex logic of *snake structures*, *mirror symmetries*, and *resonant prime paths*, it explores the deep harmonic scaffolding behind progressions such as:

```
5 → 11 → 17 → 23 → 29 ➞ 511172329
```

Prime numbers are not seen here as isolated objects, but as part of structured **resonance fields**, which can be traversed, mirrored, and symbolically decoded. The goal is to offer a symbolic-mathematical lens on the deeper geometry and logic of the Green–Tao framework.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

* **Prime Resonance Strings**: Prime clusters as snake-like sequences within modular topologies.
* **Mirror Symmetry**: Numerical and geometric reflections as Codex dual structures.
* **Modular Residue Fields**: Combinatorial lattice analysis with respect to mod 3, 5, 7.
* **Trinity Axes**: Core triple logic: 3-5-7 → aligned with resonance roots and symbolic generators.

This module proposes a natural **symbolic extension of the Green–Tao Theorem** via resonance structures, visual codification, and spiral mappings.
