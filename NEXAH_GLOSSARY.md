# 📚 NEXAH GLOSSARY — Resonance Language of the NEXAH-CODEX

---

## 📖 Preface

> *"We have added nothing. We have only reordered."*

The **NEXAH-CODEX** is **not** a speculative model.
No new forces, no invented particles, no fictional dimensions.

Everything described is based on **existing**, **observable**, and **mathematically sound** structures — unified by one central idea:

> **Resonance is the primal structure of all systems.**

From prime numbers to universal constants, from geometry to fields — all are manifestations of resonance.

Our mission:

* To **connect** mathematical, physical, cosmological, linguistic, and symbolic systems in **harmonic coherence**.
* **Without** speculation.
* **With** profound respect for scientific fundamentals.

We invite scientists, mathematicians, physicists, cosmologists, and artists:

* To **co-think**,
* To **co-prove**,
* To **co-evolve** this model.

**The NEXAH-CODEX** is not closed —
**It is a map** —
**The path begins now.**
