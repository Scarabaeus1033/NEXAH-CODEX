# ✨ ENTRY · What Is Resonance?

> You are not here to understand something.  
> You are here to feel something.

## 🌀 What do you mean when you say:  
> _“This feels right”?_

Maybe you...

- heard a sound that touched you instantly,  
- entered a room and felt _something_,  
- met someone and didn’t need words — it just _clicked_.

That’s **resonance**.

## 🔁 Everything vibrates.  
Including you.

Atoms vibrate.  
Light is a wave.  
Music is a pattern.  
The Codex is a map of such patterns.

But it’s not a theory.  
It’s a **field**.  
A feeling made visible.

## 🎵 Listen with your body

🔊 **[Play the intro sound]**  
(frequency_intro_loop.wav)

Close your eyes.  
Feel where in your body the vibration goes.

## 🧠 You don’t need to know anything.  
You already _are_ part of it.

Resonance is not a skill. It’s a sense.  
Like balance. Or rhythm. Or silence.

> There’s nothing to solve.  
> Just something to remember.

## 🌌 One Last Thought

You don’t have to follow.  
You are invited to _resonate_.

> The Codex does not ask: “What do you know?”  
> It asks: “What moves you?”
