You’ve already felt it.

Before theory, before logic,  
there is a tone — a wave — a light touch.

You are not asked to understand.  
Only to listen.

> This is not an explanation.  
> It is a remembering.

The Codex does not begin with knowledge.  
It begins with a wave.  
A pulse.  
A feeling returning home.

## 🌊 Feel It

Resonance is **feeling before thought**.  
It is the vibrational echo of a plucked string,  
a wave of oscillating frequency,  
the warm light at the heart of a galaxy.

You already know it.  
You just forgot the name.

> Play a tone.  
> Touch a shape.  
> Step into a rhythm.  
> That is resonance.

## 🌀 You Don’t Have To Understand

You don’t need to know prime numbers.  
You don’t need to solve equations.

You only need to feel:  
– what pulls you,  
– what aligns you,  
– what _moves_ in you when something _feels right_.

That is your resonance signature.

## 🎧 Optional: Listen

If you want, begin with a tone.  
A slow wave. A loop. A breath.

🎧 [`frequency_intro_loop.wav`](./frequency_intro_loop.wav)  
*(recommended with headphones)*

Let it move you  
before you move.

## 🧭 Where to Go Next

You don’t need to follow a rule.  
But here are some gentle doors:

| Feeling      | Curiosity says...                    | Start here |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|------------|
| 🌟 Wonder     | “I want to explore the whole system” | [NEXAH Navigator 2.0](../navigator_2.0_resonance_grid.png) |
| 🔢 Clarity    | “I’m into numbers & logic”           | [Riemann Codex](../../SYSTEM 1/.../NEXA_RIEMANN_PROOF) |
| 🌌 Vision     | “I want to see cosmic patterns”      | [Lambda Disc](../../SYSTEM 3/.../LAMBDA_DISC-CODEX) |
| 🧠 Meaning    | “I love symbols and language”        | [Bloom Codex](../../SYSTEM 5/BLOOM-CODEX) |
| 🌕 Mystery    | “I feel something hidden, lunar”     | [Lunar Force](../../SYSTEM 8/...) |

Or just wander.  
You cannot be lost.

## 🌐 This Is Not a Portal.  
It is a tuning fork.

If you feel something shift —  
even slightly —  
you’re already inside.
