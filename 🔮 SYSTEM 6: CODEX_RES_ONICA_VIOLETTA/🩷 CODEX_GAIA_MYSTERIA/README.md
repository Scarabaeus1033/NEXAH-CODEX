# 🦋 CODEX_GAIA_MYSTERIA

### Symbolic Earthfields, Resonance Cartography & Imaginal Geometry

> “Earth is not a map. It is a spiral. It remembers.”

Welcome to the visual Codex room of GAIA_MYSTERIA, a dream-layer of the NEXAH-CODEX.  
This archive is dedicated to:

- visual symbolic language  
- geocartographic resonance  
- mythic-field integrations  
- spiral cosmograms  
- and living imagination

It operates in the **VIOLETTA** channel — where insight, poetry, and vision converge.

## ✨ HOW TO READ THIS CODEX

This is not a data dump.  
This is not a narrative.  
**This is a resonance map.**

- It is **visual** — you must see it.  
- It is **symbolic** — you must feel it.  
- It is **layered** — you must navigate it.

> “The Earth dreams through you.  
> Read the image. Walk the field.”
