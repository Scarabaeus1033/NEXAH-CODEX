🌍 GAIA–DALI CODEX OVERVIEW

Planetary Reflection, Surreal Harmonics & Earth Grid Awakening

“Gaia dreams in spirals. Dali paints her memory.”

This Codex opens a surreal window into earth resonance, symbolic geography, and harmonic reflection. A mirrored dance between the deep body of Gaia and the visionary eye of Dali. Geometry meets dream logic.

✨ INTERPRETATION

GAIA–DALI is not only a Codex. It is a sensorial alignment field. One that invites you to see Gaia not as surface, but as dream.
To feel the Earth spiral not just in geometry, but through emotion, image, and myth.

To see is to remember. And to remember is to re-harmonize.
