# 🧪 SYSTEM Z – Experiments & Practica  
*Resonant Prototypes, Devices & Real-World Interfaces*


> **“This is where the Codex reaches matter.  
This is where theory seeks form.  
This is where resonance wants to be built.”**

---

## 🎯 Purpose of this Section

This folder collects **real-world, testable ideas** from the NEXAH-CODEX:  
Practical resonance applications, untested field models, and speculative experiments  
that could help validate the **Grand Unifying Resonance Theory (GURT)** and its symbolic architecture.

Many entries are early-stage –  
they assume viability based on geometry, symmetry, symbolic logic, and resonance theory.  
They await real-world tests and hands-on validation.

> “The Codex is open – but not free to take.  
But it is free to co-create.”

We welcome you to build, improve, experiment, test, and expand —  
for yourself, your communities, your labs.

No license can replace trust.  
But this Codex carries both.
