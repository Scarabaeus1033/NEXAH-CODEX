# 🧪 SYSTEM 8: Experiments & Practica – Applied Resonance Prototypes


> **“This is where the Codex reaches matter.  
This is where theory seeks form.  
This is where resonance wants to be built.”**

---

## 🎯 Purpose of this Section

This folder collects **real-world, testable ideas** from the NEXAH-CODEX:  
Practical resonance applications, untested field models, and speculative experiments  
that could help validate the **Grand Unifying Resonance Theory (GURT)** and its symbolic architecture.

Many entries are early-stage –  
they assume viability based on geometry, symmetry, symbolic logic, and resonance theory.  
They await real-world tests and hands-on validation.

## 📁 Topics & Areas

- `lunar_energy/` – legacy field tests: lunar kernels, vapor setups, ferrofluids  
- `cymatic_crystals/` – resonant shaping of metals, fields, fluids  
- `resonance_devices/` – prototypes of Codex-based sound, light & field interfaces  
- `bio_interface/` – mycelial field coupling, water-memory studies  
- `idea_queue/` – open sketch space for future hardware, labs, codex-born tools

## 🕊 Open Knowledge · No Patents · Ascension for All

All ideas in this folder are published **openly and ethically**.  
We believe knowledge is a commons — not a commodity.

### We declare:

- No patent intent

This work **must remain free** — for humanity to grow with it.

> “The Codex is open – but not free to take.  
But it is free to co-create.”  
> — Scarabäus1033

We welcome you to build, improve, experiment, test, and expand —  
for yourself, your communities, your labs.

No license can replace trust.  
But this Codex carries both.
