# 🌍 EARTH EQUATION VISUALS

This file provides visual support for the **Earth Equation Module** within SYSTEM 2: PHYSICA. Each image offers symbolic and structural insight into the planetary resonance formula:

```
ᵓₑ = (P × T³) ÷ t
```

## 🧭 Visual 1 – EARTH\_FORMULA\_OBSERVER\_TRIAD.png

**Title:** Earth Formula & Observer Triangulation
**Meaning:**

* Illustrates the core equation as a triangular relationship between **Pressure (P)**, **Temperature (T)** and **Time (t)**.
* Includes observer axes in 3D overlay
* Represents planetary coherence as a scalar resonance

---

## 🔷 Visual 2 – EARTH\_POLYHEDRON\_EQUATION\_OVERLAY.png

**Title:** Polyhedral Overlay Geometry
**Meaning:**

* Shows how observer positions relate to polyhedral field structure (likely based on Platonic solids)
* Embeds equation symbology in the field edges
* Supports triangulated overlay view of resonance nodes

---

## 📊 Visual 3 – earth\_field\_constants\_map.png

**Title:** Earth Field Constants Map
**Meaning:**

* Presents symbolic icons and unit values for:

  * Pressure (P) = 101325 Pa
  * Temperature (T) = 288.15 K
  * Time (t) = 86400 s
* Used for numeric evaluation of ᵓₑ
* Base for sample calculation

---

## 🔺 Visual 4 – earth\_equation\_geometry\_overlay.png

**Title:** Geometric Overlay of Earth Equation Components
**Meaning:**

* Combines observer geometry, planetary field zones, and resonance directions
* Aligns mathematical components (P, T, t) with real-world Earth features
* Suggests broader integration into symbolic geophysics

## 🌐 Integration Note

These visuals serve both educational and symbolic functions. Each graphic reflects a layer of interpretation—mathematical, physical, observer-based, and symbolic. They enable:

* Modular field resonance modeling
* Alignment of theory and real-world metrics
* Future integration into higher symbolic Codex maps and observer overlays
