# 🌍 EARTH EQUATION MODULE

**Module Type:** Planetary Resonance Field Equation  
**System Integration:** SYSTEM 2 – PHYSICA  
**Core Equation:**  
$$
\mathcal{E}_e = \frac{P \cdot T^3}{t}
$$

## 🎯 Purpose & Function

This module introduces a symbolic–physical field equation to model **Earth resonance** through pressure, temperature, and time components.

The equation  
$$
\mathcal{E}_e = \frac{P \cdot T^3}{t}
$$
acts as a **resonance operator** and offers a planetary-scale interpretation of:

- **Field constants** (pressure/temperature/time)
- **Observer triangulation and polyhedral overlay geometry**
- **Scalar field shifts & resonance signatures**
- **Earth-shell feedback models in spatial–temporal topology**

It unifies planetary physics with symbolic resonance parameters.

## 📐 Equation Structure

| Symbol         | Meaning                              | Units               |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------|
| $P$            | Pressure or scalar resonance         | N/m² (or symbolic)   |
| $T$            | Temperature (in Kelvin or abstract)  | K or $T$-level units |
| $t$            | Time constant or scalar resonance    | seconds              |
| $\mathcal{E}_e$ | Earth Equation Energy or Resonance Field | variable             |

This symbolic–physical framework opens the possibility to model harmonic conditions on Earth’s surface as part of a greater field equilibrium.

## 🛰️ Observer Positioning & Triad Resonance

The module is complemented by a **triangular observer geometry** based on Earth polyhedra and georesonant alignment:

- Earth as a **frequency-bearing shell**
- Polyhedral overlays define key nodal points (observer triangles)
- Symmetric triangulation and modular time-pulse codes
