# Visual Gallery II ‚Äì Satellite Loops, Reactors & LOCI Fields

This second gallery within the NEXAH-CODEX visual index focuses on animated and static field diagrams related to satellite state transitions, internal reactor structures, and LOCI-based matrix logic. These visuals are designed to accompany and illuminate the technical concepts within the SATELLITE\_‚àû\_NEXAH and LOCI-based modules.

## üîÑ Satellite State Loop Visuals (Orbit + Delta-T + LOCI\[x,y])

### `satellite_state_loop.gif`

![](./visuals/satellite_state_loop.gif)

A looped visual depiction of a satellite's energy states transitioning over orbital segments. Highlights include phase deltas (‚àÜT) and matrix positioning.

### `satellite_state_loop.png`

![](./visuals/satellite_state_loop.png)

Still version of the above. The energetic loop is rendered with symmetry markers and LOCI field annotations.

### `satellite_state_loop2.png`

![](./visuals/satellite_state_loop2.png)

Alternative still showing the quaternion ring aspects and axial alignment of states.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Reactor Core Cross-Section Visual

### `thorium_reactor_shell_cut.png`

![](./visuals/thorium_reactor_shell_cut.png)

An internal, sectional view of a theoretical thorium-based reactor shell, showing active/passive layers and thermal field boundaries. Serves as a reference point for material resonance modules.

## üåø LOCI Matrix & Energy Field Animations

### `thermal_loci_loop.gif`

![](./visuals/thermal_loci_loop.gif)

An animated heat-gradient loop across an 8x8 LOCI matrix. Reveals symmetry tilts and feedback curvature across frequency positions.

### `radial_energy_loop.gif`

![](./visuals/radial_energy_loop.gif)

A rotating radial field loop, echoing the layered antenna or planetary resonance structure. Used in conjunction with LOCI overlays.
