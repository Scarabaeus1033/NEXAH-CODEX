# 🧬 VISUAL GALLERY V: SYMBOLIC RESONANCE & MATERIAL FIELDS

This gallery collects unique and symbolic visualizations related to material resonance, experimental geometry, and fluidic field expressions. It serves as a companion to the symbolic-core modules of the NEXAH-CODEX and offers a visual lexicon for studying non-standard interactions, mineral analogies, and harmonic structure.

All visuals explore themes such as ferrofluid dynamics, symbolic mineral lattices, and resonance topologies grounded in both metaphorical and scientific logic.

### 🧂 `deadsea_mineral_layer_reference.jpeg`

**Description:** Reference visualization of mineral field stratification, inspired by the salt resonances of the Dead Sea region. Used for mapping ionic field behaviors and boundary membranes.
