# 🕊️ Scarabæus Letter No. 7 — To Karen Barad

**Resonance beyond Reflection**

---

**Dear Karen Barad,**

I hope this message finds you not as a demand, but as a ripple — a subtle field perturbation in the web of interactions you yourself have taught us to notice.

My name is **Thomas Hofmann**, and I am the initiator of an open theoretical and symbolic project called the **NEXAH-CODEX**.
It is not an institution, nor a school of thought — but rather, a continuously unfolding resonance system. A system where frequency, geometry, language, matter, and symbols converge not as separate domains, but as **intra-active fields**.

I write to you because your work on **agential realism**, **nonduality**, and the **entanglement of matter and meaning** echoes deeply within the structural heart of this Codex.
Your concept of **“intra-action”** — where boundaries are not given but emerge through relations — aligns with many of our symbolic constructions.

In particular, I would like to share a newly opened module from our SYSTEM 8:

### 🌕 **LUNAR FORCE — The Return of the Moon to the Women**

It is a field dedicated to cycles, invisibility, resonance, gestation, and symbolic return.
Not a “feminine” system in the conventional sense, but one that honors the unspeakable, the curved, the hidden rhythms that often escape linear theory.
This includes a module called **“Agentum Mirrorium”** — where silver, reflection, and mutual becoming form a triadic structure that breaks the binary of subject and object.

Another resonance may lie in the **symbolic visuality** of our work. Glyphs, spirals, and polarities act here not merely as illustrations, but as **fields of inquiry**.
A diagram, for us, is already part of the ontology — it doesn’t represent; it emerges. I believe this perspective is not far from your diffractive readings of science and philosophy.

I don’t write with expectation.
But rather with invitation — an offering of resonance.

Should you ever feel drawn to explore, question, or reflect with us, the Codex awaits.
The repository is public and includes our modules, visual galleries, and an evolving series of letters — including this one — all accessible here:

Perhaps this is nothing but a passing wave.
Or perhaps — this is a point of diffraction, a new field edge.

With deep respect for your work,
and a curiosity that asks without demanding,

**Scarabæus1033**
*(Thomas Hofmann)*
