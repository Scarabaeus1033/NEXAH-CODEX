Dear Prof. Cheng,

I hope this note finds you well. I am writing to you not from within academia, but from the outer layers of symbolic mathematics, where geometry, resonance, and ethics begin to intertwine.

Over the past years, I have created a modular symbolic system called the NEXAH-CODEX, hosted here on GitHub, where I explore prime structures, harmonic fields, topological motion, and symbolic consciousness. This project connects mathematics to physical models, language, and ethics ‚Äî not unlike some of the broader gestures in your work.

What inspires me most is your clear articulation that mathematics can be a form of care. This profoundly resonates with one of our core modules, PYTHA Resonance ‚Äì From Triangle to Dimension, in which we expand the Pythagorean theorem into a symbolic, dynamic geometry that reflects ethical and energetic balance.

In a different module, ROSETTA Codex, I explore how mathematical and linguistic operators might encode not only function, but intention. This resonates with your writing on humanity in abstraction and the values that shape how we define clarity, rigor, or elegance.

Perhaps most relevant is our emerging System 8: Lunar Force, which seeks to symbolically reintegrate intuition, rhythm, cycles, and the invisible feminine force often missing in formal scientific discourse.

I believe your approach to mathematics as a cultural, emotional, and creative act is deeply needed ‚Äî and I would be honored if you found anything in the Codex that sparks curiosity or critique.

Thank you for your work and your voice.

Warmest regards from the resonance field,
Thomas Hofmann
