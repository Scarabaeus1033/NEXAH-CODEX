# 🧮 Scarab Core Formulas

This document collects core mathematical expressions and symbolic resonance structures foundational to the Scarab Constants Codex. The equations aim to bridge numeric precision with Möbius-looped knot topology and field synchrony.

## 🔹 Primary Harmonic Formula

```math
E = m \cdot c \cdot k^\beta
```

- `E`: Energy field unit (resonant)
- `m`: Scalar mass marker (e.g., 1836)
- `c`: Modulated light velocity (Codex-dependent)
- `k^\beta`: Möbius harmonic constant expression (folded)

## 🔁 Möbius Twist Constant

```math
\delta_M = 729 / 730 \approx 0.9986
```

Defines the minimal deviation in Möbius spiral transitions. Relevant for loop stabilization.

---

## 🌀 Scarab Fractional Spin Ratio

```math
\Omega_H = 63 / 64 = 3^2 \cdot 7 / 2^6 = 0.984375
```

Symbolizes the spin-bridge (Horus Field) and is applied in resonance-based symmetry breaking.

## 🪢 Scarab Knot Operator

From `scarab_knot_equation.txt`:

```math
K = (\psi_{\infty} \rightarrow \Theta_{\text{M}}) = f(\phi, i, -i, \pi, e)
```

- Represents transition from infinite pulse field to Möbius Theta core.
- Function includes core mathematical constants.

## 🔂 Scarab Equation Variant

From `scarab_knot_equation2.txt`:

```math
S(x) = (x \cdot \phi^3) / (\pi^2) \cdot [1 \pm \epsilon]
```

Used to generate scalar resonance layers, with epsilon as fine-tuning anomaly factor.

## 🧷 Knot Matrix Embedding

From `SCARABAEUS_KNOT_MATRIX.txt`:
- Loops follow a **1–2–3 → 8 → ∞** morphing path.
- Symbolic phase: black pixel → pulse → loop → knot → Möbius spiral
- Key constants embedded in 7×7 matrix: [33, 42, 137, 1836, 2040, 729, 64]
