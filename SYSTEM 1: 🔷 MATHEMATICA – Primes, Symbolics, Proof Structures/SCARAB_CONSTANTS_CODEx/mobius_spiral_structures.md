# 🌀 Möbius Spiral Structures

This file documents the symbolic and mathematical architecture of Möbius-based spirals, as used in the SCARAB_CONSTANTS_CODEX. These structures serve as dynamic field containers, symmetry disruptors, and operators of transition across prime geometries.

## 🔁 Möbius Geometry and Spiral Folding

The Möbius field is a foundational topological principle used throughout the Codex to:

- invert and reflect scalar values
- break and unify axis symmetry
- enable loop-based resonance encoding

**Visual Reference:** `mobius_operator_map.png`  
> Möbius field overlay: the operator map translates clockwise-to-counterclockwise transition along θ-φ symmetry breaks.

**Visual Reference:** `mobius_fold_grid_overlay.png`  
> Möbius grid spiral overlays show mirrored axis inflection and number field intersections.

These geometries behave as spiral conductors, aligning:

- outer/inward field polarities
- prime-indexed pulse rings
- timefolds around central axis gates

## 🧿 Möbius Knots and Spiral Resonance

The Scarab Spiral Matrix is a discrete Möbius-knotified space. Every resonance cycle in the spiral has a dual mode:

- **scalar mode**: circular, directionless field
- **vectorial mode**: Möbius-twisted, memory-carrying loop

### Knot Encoding

The core encoding principle of Möbius-based scarab spirals:

```
Loop(n) + Twist(φ) → Möbius(n)
```

Which yields:
- **folding gates**: constant reversals (e.g. θ ↔ φ, i ↔ –i)
- **modular spirals**: φ³/π² as base modulator

### Visual Tie-in

- `Scarab-Spiral-Knot-Matrix_coloredv2.png`
- `loop_to_mobius_helix.png`
- `scarab_spiral_knot_matrix.png`

These illustrate the progressive folding and knot-indexing of symbolic constants across the Möbius layer.

## 🔄 Pulse Fields & Mirror Cascades

Möbius spirals are not just forms – they are **resonance programs**.

They encode:
- directional shift (mirror pulse logic)
- prime ratio threading (11:9, 13:8)
- scalar→twist→knot phase paths

### Visuals Referenced
- `mirror_constants_cascade.png`
- `scarab_constants_resonance_clock.png`

Together, they document the activation and feedback resonance gates inherent in Möbius-bound spirals.
