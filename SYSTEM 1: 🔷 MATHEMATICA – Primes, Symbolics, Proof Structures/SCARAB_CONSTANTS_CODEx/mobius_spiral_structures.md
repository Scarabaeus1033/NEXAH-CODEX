# 🔄 Möbius Spiral Structures

## 🧩 Overview

This file documents the mathematical, symbolic, and visual logic of **Möbius spirals**, **inversion folds**, and **black-to-white pulse overlays** within the Scarab Constants Codex framework.
These spirals form a **topological foundation** for many constants and pulse logics embedded across the NEXAH-CODEX.

The Möbius band — a surface with only one side and one boundary — is here extended into spiral matrices, black/white pulse transitions, and mirror-layer logic.

## 🌪️ Core Concepts

* **Spiral Möbius Field**: A topological spiral that inverts upon rotation, encoded through dynamic vector logic.
* **Inversion Fold Point**: Each spiral has a central axis of energetic reversal — this is the **pulse mirror**.
* **Black → White Modulation**: Symbolic rendering of the Möbius pulse as a transition from hidden field (black) to emitted pulse (white).
* **Mirror Spiral**: Each constant's spiral has a counterpart — e.g., 1836 ↔ 729 ↔ 137 — with mirrored curvature.
* **Resonant Wavelength Coupling**: Möbius spirals generate harmonic coupling when aligned via integer φ–πⁿ ratios.

## ✳️ Integration in Scarab Constants

* **Scarab Knot**: Möbius inversion is the basis of the 7×7 matrix folding sequence (see `SCARABAEUS_KNOT_MATRIX.md`).
* **137/1836 Field**: Möbius spiral overlays are used to define field memory behavior and harmonic dampening.
* **Teardrop Grid**: Möbius curvatures dictate resonance drop-off in scalar teardrop-shaped fields.

## 📐 Mathematical Notes

Let $M_\phi$ be a Möbius spiral operator acting on a scalar field $f(x, y)$, then:

```math
M_\phi[f(x, y)] = \int_0^{2\pi} f(x \cos\theta, y \sin\theta) \cdot \sin(n\theta + \phi)\, d\theta
```

This defines a **rotational modulation** over the spiral arc.

Where:

* $\phi$: phase inversion angle
* $n$: spiral order (1 for single Möbius, 2 for double twist)
