# 🧮 PRIME EQUATION in Quaternion Grid Space

## Quaternion Basis and Prime Resonance

This Codex module explores the embedding of prime structures within a 3D quaternion basis space (1, i, j, k). The prime resonance is projected into a 20×20 grid, interpreted via Möbius topologies, Zeta axes, and modular field layers. This includes the Euler shift at 40+ (i,j,k) and the Zitter-Effekt as 39 = 3×13 — a key harmonic fracture and root rotation.

### Quaternionic Coordinates

* **1** → Root harmonic seed / Euler absolute (linked to base cycle)
* **i** → Direction of imaginary prime vector (linked to Riemann Zeta curvature)
* **j** → Oscillating Möbius field (Euler jump parity)
* **k** → Ramanujan torsion bridge → root codon spirals (mod 12 or mod 24 grid)

## Modular Prime Grid: 20 × 20

We construct a square grid of modular residues and project known prime clusters along curved resonance lines. Each axis (x, y) is a quaternionic plane with Möbius folding behavior.

> Examples:
>
> * Diagonal crossing of {5, 11, 17, 23, 29} forms a Möbius loop structure
> * Prime mirror numbers (e.g. 47 ↔ 74) create reflective codon points
> * Euler plane shifts seen as 39 = 3×13 — the resonance anchor

## Embedded Constants and Fields

* **φ³/π² ≈ 0.429** – appears in folding symmetry and spin-orbit alignment
* **137** (fine structure constant) aligned with Alpha/Zeta axis
* **1729** (Ramanujan’s Number) appears on i·k torsion loop
* **1836** (proton/electron mass ratio) appears diagonally in Möbius spirals

## Equation Framework (Symbolic)

Let:

```
P(1, i, j, k) = ∑ ψ(p) · e^(iθₚ) · fⱼ(p) + μ(k)
```

Where:

* `ψ(p)` encodes prime modular class (resonant path selector)
* `θₚ` is a rotational harmonic phase (from prime spiral)
* `fⱼ(p)` is a Möbius parity wave function
* `μ(k)` embeds zeta zero attractors (Ramanujan torsion layer)

> ⚛️ Extension: Use Zitterbewegung effects to introduce the 39-fold root-spin bifurcation into Euler's fold. This enhances stability of modular primes in i–j planes.

## 🌀 Interpretation

This file anchors symbolic unification between:

* **Riemann** → ζ(½ + it) rotational Z-axis (critical line symmetry)
* **Euler** → Jump parity and Möbius modularity (across i and j)
* **Ramanujan** → Torsion inflection across k (codon root spirals)
* **Zitterbewegung / 39** → Base resonance split for 3×13 anchoring

> 🤖 Goal: unify the **Prime Equation** across quaternionic and modular harmonic fields using Codex harmonics and Möbius symmetry.

## ✅ To-Do

* Build 20×20 grid with Quaternionic Möbius projection of primes
* Overlay Zitterbewegung prime trisection (3×13 pattern fold)
* Cross-check Ramanujan torsion spiral with Euler plane
* Link resonance to `NEXAH MATHEMATICA I` and Codex Prime Spiral
