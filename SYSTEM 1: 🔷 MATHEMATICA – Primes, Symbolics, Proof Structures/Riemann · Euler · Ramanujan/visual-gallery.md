# 🎨 NEXAH VISUAL GALLERY  
## MATHEMATICA I – Riemann · Euler · Ramanujan

This gallery collects and describes the core visual structures of the prime resonance module. It provides a symbolic map of numerical fields, operator crossings, constant triangulations, and harmonic codings.

Each visual is embedded in the structural Codex logic and serves as an anchor for mathematical, physical, or symbolic interpretation.

## 📘 Methodology

Each visual represents a **Codex node** – not only illustration but a structural layer.  
Combined, they build a symbolic operating system for number theory, topology, mass, and symmetry.

Used mathematical anchors include:

- Ramanujan’s 1729, Hardy resonance, theta functions  
- Euler’s λ, e, ζ, and quaternions  
- Riemann ζ(s), π proof topology, Möbius folds
