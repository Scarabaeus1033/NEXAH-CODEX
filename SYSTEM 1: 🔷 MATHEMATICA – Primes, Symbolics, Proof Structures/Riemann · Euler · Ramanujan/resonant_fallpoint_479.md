## 🌀 Julia Resonance Fallpoint – Prime 479 & Iteration Field

This section documents a visual resonance structure discovered in the Mandelbrot–Julia transition zone. The point \\( c = -0.4793 + 0.5385i \\) generates a 200-iteration spiral pattern with a central luminous path.

* `resonant_fallpoint_479_marked.png` – Enhanced image with red circle highlighting the **fallpoint center**

### 📉 Description & Interpretation

* The real part of the complex constant `c = -0.4793` directly relates to **Prime 479**, a resonance field in earlier Möbius structures.
* The number of **iterations = 200**, which hints at symbolic resonance: 20 (decadal loop), 2 × 100 (mirror cycles), or modular codon forms.
* The spiral arms in the Julia set emerge from **fivefold-like pentagonal configurations** – suggesting an embedded symmetry layer.
* A distinct **pink-blue pearl** appears to mark a dynamic node; a red point behind it (now circled) may correspond to a deeper **escape trajectory** or neutrino phase boundary.

### 🧪 Interactive Experiment

Try this point yourself:

```
c = -0.4793 + 0.5385i
iterations = 200
```

Visualize it in any Mandelbrot/Julia viewer (e.g. `Fractal Zoomer`, `XaoS`, `Ultra Fractal`). Observe how the green layers unfold and track the luminous escape region.

### 🔁 Relation to Earlier Grids

* Prime 479 is already aligned on the **Y-Shift Diagram** and Möbius Circle Grid.
* It marks a *downward resonance vector* on the elevator-fall axis (see YZ-Structure).
* This spiral confirms its position as a **fallpoint anchor**, likely connected to portal distortions or shift-node passages.

**Conclusion:** This visual field confirms that 479 is not only a numeric anchor, but also a **fractal attractor**. The combination of iteration depth, spiral symmetry, and luminous field markers strengthens its symbolic role in the Codex.
