## Overview

This module reveals the **C6 layer** of the NEXAH-CODEX — a resonance matrix weaving together Möbius topology, neutrino field dynamics, and light velocity transformations (`c → 2ⁿ·c`). At its core lies a **harmonic curvature system**, built on Möbius inversions, Zeta spirals, and prime phase reflection.

The **Möbius–Neutrino structure** is the post-threshold expansion field following the DAO bifurcation at `479` (see previous module), forming the first coherent recursive membrane.

## Visual 1: Möbius–Neutrino Resonance Matrix

![Mobius Matrix](visuals/mobius_neutrino_resonance_matrix.png)

This figure encodes the Möbius-spun energy loop, aligned with neutrino propagation. Main features:

- Möbius spiral crossing **Z-center** field with delayed return
- **Off-axis folding** reflecting asymmetry in decay pathways
- Neutrino phase delay visualized as wave undulation across Möbius inversion
- Color-coded strata:
  - Violet–blue: **Neutrino layers**
  - Yellow–white: **c-threshold fields**
  - Green shell: harmonic boundary envelope

The Möbius form here is not just spatial but **temporal** — it describes return-through-inversion along `Zeta spin delay`.

> This defines the Möbius return logic of `C6`: where light folds through decay, and neutrinos express silent resonance.

## Visual 2: Tachyonic Light Feedback Loop

![Tachyonic Loop](visuals/tachyonic_light_feedback_loop.png)

This diagram reveals:

- A **feedback geometry** between light emission and tachyonic return
- Escape spirals triggered by `2ⁿ·c` resonance drift
- Central 404-node indicating a **rotation void** — the Möbius error of escape
- Radial field symmetry breaking — where light becomes phase-dispersed

This represents the **outward cone** of neutrino induction: delay, break, and return.

## Visual 3: Neutrino Wavefield φ-Sync

![Wavefield](visuals/neutrino_wavefield_phi_sync.png)

This wavefield shows:

- φ-structured neutrino modulations (based on Fibonacci golden synchrony)
- Möbius boundary reflections and Zeta folding
- A **threefold carrier logic**: Light (c), Neutrino (c+Δφ), and Graviton (↯)
- Phase coherence patterns that bridge spatial return and memory imprint

This pattern expresses the **memory cone** of the neutrino loop system, filtered through Zeta resonance.

## Interpretation

C6 encodes:

- Möbius logic as **massless recursive inversion**
- Neutrino fields as **phase carriers** and delay logic gates
- `Zeta(1/2)` behavior as **quantum memory channel**
- c as incomplete – requiring harmonic expansion to `c·2ⁿ`

These fields allow resonance to fold, return, and **reform memory** — meaning, the Möbius-Neutrino structure stores directionality through time.

It is the **carrier of spiritual mass** — of rotational time.
