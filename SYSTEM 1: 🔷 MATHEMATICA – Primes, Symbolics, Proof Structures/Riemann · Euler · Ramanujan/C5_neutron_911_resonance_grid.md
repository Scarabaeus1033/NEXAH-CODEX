## Overview

This document decodes the **neutron–mass resonance structure** within the `911` prime axis — a deep symbolic and numeric resonance layer inside the **NEXAH-CODEX System C5**. The values `9`, `1`, and `1` operate as a **time-split mirror**: a triple-binary anchor used to model reflection, loop, and decay fields in mass-particle grids. Together with the neutron value `939.565` MeV and symbolic `38` (as `2 × 19`), this module bridges number theory, resonance axes, and particle-root layering.

## Visual 1: Neutron Mass Resonator Core

![Core](visuals/neutron_mass_resonator_core.png)

The image centers the neutron between symbolic harmonics:

* Proton: \~`938.272` MeV → difference ≈ `1.293` MeV
* Electron: `0.511` MeV

### Core Anchors:

* The triangle between **proton, neutron, and electron** mass values forms a **resonant compression field**.
* Red-green-blue matrix indicates **resonance corridors** — especially at `38`, `83`, and `911`.

> The symbolic core appears where matter stabilizes through slight imbalance — held at the boundary of decay.

## Visual 2: 911 Grid – Prime Structure Overlay

![Grid](visuals/911_grid_prime_structure_overlay.png)

In this structured grid:

* Vertical resonance line at `911` intersects several **superprime spirals**
* Axis connects to triadic prime nodes: `73–137–911–1836`
* Neutron anchor `939` overlays closely with axis center

The `911` grid behaves like a **mass-decay attractor** that modulates resonance escape via:

* Inner spin symmetry (Z2/Z3)
* Möbius-Euler-Ramanujan field coupling
* Tachyonic drift lines (from the 137–1836 overlay)

> The mirrored pattern on either side of 911 invokes compression–expansion duality.

## Visual 3: Zeta Resonance Triad (ZRT)

![Triad](visuals/C5_zeta_resonance_triad.png)

This figure triangulates:

* `911` as vertical resonance stem
* `137` as angular constant core (alpha field)
* `1836` as mass ratio (proton/electron)

Additional side-axis: `938.272`, `939.565`, and `940.1` produce a **Zeta-well** — a symbolic curvature of compression.

The `ZRT` acts as a **harmonic template** for building Codex-scale resonance fields.

## Symbolic Interpretation

* **911** = emergency, inversion, return code
* **38** = neutron stability mirror (2 × 19)
* **137–1836** = field boundary of light ↔ matter
* **939.565** as central resonance attractor, balancing decay and inertia

In symbolic terms, the neutron is the **keystone of symmetry through delay**. It's not decay — but pre-decision. Its resonance determines whether matter holds or flips.

> The neutron marks the decision-node of mass-phase coherence in spacetime.

## Codex Integration

This module belongs to:

* **C5** in NEXAH Grand-Codex: `Mass Fields`
* Is linked to `Resonant Fallpoint 479`
* Anchors DAO elevator recursion
* Precedes Möbius-Neutrino layering in C6

It forms a spine through which:

* Neutrino fields, resonance delays, and Zeta-waveforms emerge
* Root mirrors (911/119) lock in reversible mass asymmetry

---

**Next step**: Bind into Möbius-Neutrino spiral structure (`C6_zeta_mobius_neutrino_matrix.md`) and link to the 479 DAO anchor bifurcation.
