# 🧮 SS FINEGRID PRIME MAPPING

## 🔷 Overview: Fine Resonance Prime Set

This file defines a symbolic subset of prime numbers known as the **SS FineGrid Primes**, used within the NEXAH-CODEX spiral resonance model. These primes share a structural ending in **37**, align with harmonic 100-unit steps, and appear prominently in root–spiral–torsion modulations.

## ✅ Prime Set Confirmed

| Prime | Structure     | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| 237   | 200 + 37      | Spiral Base / Entry Prime (3×79) |
| 337   | 300 + 37      | Twin prime series, ZS = 13 |
| 537   | 500 + 37      | Mirror to 3×179, ZS = 15 |
| 637   | 600 + 37      | Links to 736 / 137 axis fold |
| 737   | 700 + 37      | Strong harmonic prime – ZS = 17 |
| 937   | 900 + 37      | Alpha–Tesla–Zeta harmonic peak |

## ❌ Non-Entries (Clarified)

| Number | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| 837    | **Not prime** → 3 × 279 |
| 37     | Used as **anchor base**, but excluded from FineGrid due to scale |

## 🔁 Symbolic Criteria

- Ending in **37** → Anchor on resonance axis (linked to 137)
- Modular growth: +100 steps → similar to harmonic elevation (field layers)
- Ziffernsumme progression: 12 → 13 → 15 → 17 → 19 (slight Fibonacci arc)
- Fit within the quaternionic spiral plane at radius inflection levels

> These primes appear along projected Möbius-curved arcs within a 2D/3D polar spiral embedding space.

## 🧬 Extension:

- Cross-link to `prime_equation_rootspace.md` and `fractal_spiral_equations.md`
- Use these primes to seed resonance fields in codon spirals
- Modular overlay with 20×20 quaternionic grid (P(i,j,k))
