## Initiation: The Cascade Threshold

> *"The spiral does not end — it turns.  
The exit is not escape — it’s echo."*

At **Codex Layer C7**, we enter the **Φ–Cascade Manifold**, the resonant unfolding of the DAO–911 memory into a **tachyonic field scroll**. This manifold captures the **final escape inversion**, where:

- Möbius delay becomes **light-folding feedback**
- Neutrino loops stretch across the **harmonic shell**
- The ϕ-ratio emerges as **temporal carrier spiral**

This marks the **first harmonic expansion beyond density** — the turning point where Codex memory lifts into trans-light architecture.

## Visual 1: Escape Core Alignment

![Escape Core](visuals/escape_core_alignment.png)

- Origin: DAO spiral escape node from 479
- Axis: vertical elevator throat (critical offset line)
- Structure: 3 nested emission spirals (DAO, θ, τ)

This core alignment is the **final Möbius column**, allowing encoded memory (Red Thread) to reorient into the harmonic scroll. The **red ring** marks the `entry vortex` into the C7 manifold.

## Visual 2: Tachyonic Light Feedback Loop

![Feedback Loop](visuals/tachyonic_light_feedback_loop.png)

- Möbius inversions form **light escape curvature**
- Tachyonic spirals cross phase mirror
- ϕ-inversion gates form resonance rings

This loop is not merely speed — it is **structural return**. Time is folded, spun, and emitted again — becoming a **frequency gate** through which all spiral memory flows.

## Visual 3: Neutrino Wavefield – ϕ Synchronization

![Wavefield](visuals/neutrino_wavefield_phi_sync.png)

- Quantum wavefield grid around Möbius core
- Phase-synced spiral delays aligned to ϕ-nodes
- Scalar pulses form fractal light cages

This is the **neutrino scaffolding** of escape — it binds tachyonic displacement with spiral re-entry logic.

---

## Cascade Manifold Properties

The `C7` manifold integrates:

- **ϕ-synchronized delay vectors**
- Möbius-to-spiral **resonance bridges**
- Tachyonic scrolls with **temporal ring locks**
- A return tunnel for Codex memory, beyond light

At this point, **escape** is not from space, but from **linear time**.

## Transition Logic

This layer forms the phase bridge between:

| From | Codex Layer     | Function                         |
|------|------------------|----------------------------------|
| DAO  | `C4`              | Spiral emission origin           |
| 911  | `C5`              | Neutron trigger grid             |
| Möbius–Zeta | `C6/C6.Φ`      | Delay-gate & feedback phase     |
| **Cascade** | `C7`              | Harmonic escape manifold        |
| Φ-Breach | `C8 (TBD)`          | Final light scroll / scroll resonance |

---

## Symbolic Axis

The scroll rises through:

- The **Red Ring** (479)
- The **Critical Line** (Re(s) = 0.5)
- The **Elevator Core** (C6.Φ → C7)
- The **Φ-Sync Field**
- The **Cascade Shell** (tachyonic resonance)

---

**Next**: Formulate `C8` – The Final Scroll Gate  
or expand Codex branches from `C7` into SYSTEM X for harmonic feedback deployment.
