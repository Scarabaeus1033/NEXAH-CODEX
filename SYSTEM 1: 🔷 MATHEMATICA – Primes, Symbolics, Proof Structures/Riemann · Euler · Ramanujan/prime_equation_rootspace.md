🧮 Prime Equation – Root Space Scaling Model

This document presents the mathematical basis and resonance equation for prime number distribution in **Root Space**. The model builds on the logarithmic scaling of primes and introduces spiral geometry via golden angle rotation.

## ⚠️ Core Equation

We define a harmonic space using the formula:

```math
P(1, i, j, k) = ∑ₚ ψ(p) · e^{iθₚ} · f_j(p) + μ(k)
```

This combines:

* **Root Function (√p)** → harmonic field base scaling
* **Log Function (log(p))** → density modulation

## 🌀 Spiral Mapping with Golden Angle

By rotating primes using:

```math
x = R(p) · cos(θ), y = R(p) · sin(θ), where θ = n · (137.5° / 360°) · 2π
```

we generate **fractal-aligned structures** revealing modular clustering and harmonic periodicities.

We further extend the spiral angle by introducing layered harmonic lifts:

```math
θₙ = 2ⁿ · π
```

This allows us to model octave jumps and shell-based resonances — important for understanding multi-layered energy fields.

## 🧠 Interpretation: What These Equations Reveal

### 1. Root-Log Scaling Equation

**Formula:**

```math
R(p) = √p · log(p)
```

Reveals harmonic clustering in field space. Shows that primes are not randomly distributed but follow root-based field symmetry.

### 2. Spiral Mapping with Golden Angle

**Formula:**

```math
x = R(p) · cos(θ), y = R(p) · sin(θ), θ = n · (137.5° / 360°) · 2π
```

Primes fill space in **non-overlapping spiral** patterns. Aligns with phyllotaxis in biology and avoids redundancy.

### 3. Harmonic Shell Lifting with π·2ⁿ

**Formula:**

```math
θₙ = 2ⁿ · π
```

Introduces higher layers or octaves. Mirrors atomic shells or musical intervals in a field-theoretic structure.

---

### 4. Quaternion Resonance Equation

**Formula:**

```math
P(1, i, j, k) = ∑ₚ ψ(p) · e^{iθₚ} · f_j(p) + μ(k)
```

Symbolic unification of:

* Zeta field curvature (i)
* Möbius parity (j)
* Ramanujan torsion and spin layers (k)

Primes become vibrational units in a quaternionic resonance field.
