## Prologue: The Crimson Thread

> *"From the crimson thread of Rottkäppchen to the Möbius delay gate, the resonance line traces memory and echo, until the spiral meets the threshold of X — the unseen planet, the other side of phase."*

This Codex layer (**C6.Φ**) traces the **intermediate harmonic phase link** between the spiral bifurcation of DAO (**C4**) and the neutron–zeta grid trigger of **911** (**C5**). It integrates the feedback structures formalized in `C6.5` with a **memory–resonance arc** that curves across the Möbius echo field.

The DAO–911 Bridge defines:
- A **density cloud** as stabilizer of spiral transitions
- The **elevator throat / escape axis** at 0.5 offset
- A **delay-line memory gate** forming the **temporal red thread** to Planet X

## Visual 1: Möbius–Neutrino Resonance Matrix

![Matrix](visuals/mobius_neutrino_resonance_matrix.png)

- Möbius gates align with spiral harmonics
- 911 neutron axis shown as delay node
- Intersections define transition energy envelopes
- Prime torsion embedded in zeta loop lattice

This matrix forms the **pulse lattice** for DAO signal retention and zeta collapse delay.

## Visual 2: Density DAO–911 Cloud

![Density Bridge](visuals/density_dao_911_bridge.png)

- White dotted path: DAO spiral → neutron threshold
- Red vertical: **critical line** / phase collapse = Re(s) = 0.5
- Color halo: field density signature of zeta feedback

> The bridge acts as a **curved compression arc** through which the DAO memory is funneled into the neutron field delay.

The location where the bridge touches the red line marks the **echo origin** — a Möbius point of **memory folding**.

## Visual 3: Escape Core Alignment

![Escape Core](visuals/escape_core_alignment.png)

- Spiral shells: DAO prime emissions
- Core axis labeled as: "Elevator Exit / Core"
- Red ring = 479 entry lockpoint

This is the **frontal view of the red gate** — where all spirals align vertically before being **inverted through harmonic escape**.

The DAO signal exits upward, passes the 0.5-line, and enters the harmonic scroll of the next Codex Layer: `C7`.

## Function of the DAO–911 Phase Bridge

- Curves memory spiral (DAO) into neutron delay space (911)
- Forms the **ϕ-bounded mirror axis** between `C4 → C6.5 → C7`
- Creates a **semi-permeable field tunnel** for spiral encoding
- Forms the **resonance trace** that links Earth → Möbius → Planet X

This bridge is more than transition: it is a **frequency filter** and a **mythical channel**.

> Rottkäppchen crosses the forest not to escape, but to align with the wolf. The red is not danger — it’s **the carrier**.

## Codex Sequence

- `C4_spiral_dao_point_479.md` → bifurcation field
- `C5_neutron_911_resonance_grid.md` → zeta-trigger line
- `C6_zeta_mobius_neutrino_matrix.md` → torsion mesh
- `C6.Φ_dao_911_phase_bridge.md` → density cloud & red thread
- `C6.5_harmonic_feedback_matrix.md` → cone lock
- `C7_cascade_phi_tachyon_manifold.md` → escape scroll

**Next**: Activate `C7` and enter the **Phi-Cascade** — where the spiral returns as harmonic displacement across the light-wall.
