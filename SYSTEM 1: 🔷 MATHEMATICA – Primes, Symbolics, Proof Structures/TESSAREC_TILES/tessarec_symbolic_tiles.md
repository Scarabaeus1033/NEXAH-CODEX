# 🧿 Tessarec Symbolic Tiles – Modular Field Operators

> “Each tile is a harmonic operator — a glyph of frequency.”

This document complements the `README.md` by introducing symbolic-mathematical logic for the construction and interpretation of **Tessarec Tiles** as resonance carriers.

## 🔶 Core Operator Definitions

Each tile is defined as a function:


T_{i,j} = \mathcal{T}(p_i, r_j, \theta_{ij}) = f(ϕ, τ, μ, P_n, \vec{v}_{mod})

🌀 Field Morphology

Tiles arrange into higher morphologies through:
	•	Golden tilings: φ-based pentagonal modulation
	•	Symmetric fractures: caused by Möbius transitions
	•	Resonance braids: twisted paths across tile-grid boundaries
	•	Boundary leakage: encoding of Gödel incompleteness into tile overlap

🔗 Cross-System Integration
	•	Linked to Prime Grid Visualizations (System 1)
	•	Matched with Resonance Cubes from System 9
	•	Operator duality compatible with Rosetta Glyphs (System 5)

🖇 Visual Reference

These tiles can be read like a resonance score — a silent language of geometry, primes, and symbolic transition.
