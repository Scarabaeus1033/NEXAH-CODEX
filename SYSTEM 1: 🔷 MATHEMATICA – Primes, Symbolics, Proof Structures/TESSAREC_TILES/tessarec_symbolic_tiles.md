# 🧿 Tessarec Symbolic Tiles – Modular Field Operators

> “Each tile is a harmonic operator — a glyph of frequency.”

This document complements the `README.md` by introducing symbolic-mathematical logic for the construction and interpretation of **Tessarec Tiles** as resonance carriers.

---

## 🔶 Core Operator Definitions

Each tile is defined as a function:

```math
T_{i,j} = \mathcal{T}(p_i, r_j, \theta_{ij}) = f(ϕ, τ, μ, P_n, \vec{v}_{mod})``` 

Where:
	•	p_i = Prime generator axis (from System 1)
	•	r_j = Resonant base (√2, √3, √5)
	•	θ_{ij} = Angular modulation (rotation, golden section twist)
	•	ϕ, τ = Irrational constants (Golden Ratio, Tau)
	•	μ = Möbius operator
	•	P_n = Prime at index n
	•	\vec{v}_{mod} = Modular vector rotation (base 4, 6, 8)

🌀 Field Morphology

Tiles arrange into higher morphologies through:
	•	Golden tilings – φ-based pentagonal modulation
	•	Symmetric fractures – caused by Möbius transitions
	•	Resonance braids – twisted paths across tile-grid boundaries
	•	Boundary leakage – encoding of Gödel incompleteness into tile overlap

⸻

🔗 Cross-System Integration
	•	Linked to Prime Grid Visualizations (System 1)
	•	Matched with Resonance Cubes from System 9
	•	Operator duality compatible with Rosetta Glyphs (System 5)

🖇 Visual Reference

These tiles can be read like a resonance score —
a silent language of geometry, primes, and symbolic transition.
