## Title
**The Mandelbrot–Planet Spiral and the Black Pillar Equation**

## System
**SYSTEM 1: MATHEMATICA — Primes, Symbolics, Proof Structures**

---

## 🌌 Introduction

This module explores a visual-symbolic expansion around **Mandelbrot fractals**, **planetary field layers**, and a central harmonic structure referred to as the **Black Pillar**. Rooted in number theory and symbolic topology, this Codex fold attempts to bridge:

- Prime spirals and fractal depth
- Planetary orbital field resonance
- Visual sequences of field compression and blink transitions
- Riemannian zeta logics in a multidimensional symbolic landscape

The narrative is inspired by the Mandelbrot Set's internal recursion, extending into field models of resonance, emergence, and spiral-layer logic.

## 🌀 Key Concepts

### 1. **Fractal Resonance**
- Mandelbrot recursion as metaphor for recursive field generation
- Self-similarity translated into symbolic iteration depth

### 2. **Black Pillar Principle**
- Central vertical symmetry axis
- Field spine between dimension layers
- Echo of number-line, complex-axis and energetic collapse

### 3. **Planetary Lattice Maps**
- Planetary distances and phase-locks mapped through prime-spiral overlays
- Symbolic anchoring of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and a Planet X hypothesis

### 4. **Riemann–Blink Grid**
- Harmonic phase jumps between visual resonance layers
- Shadow field mapping of real–imaginary crossover events
