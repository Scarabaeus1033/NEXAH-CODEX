# GU-REX: Geometric Unity Resonance Extension

## 🚀 Overview

**GU-REX** (Geometric Unity Resonance Extension) extends Eric Weinstein’s original *Geometric Unity* framework by introducing a **triple resonance formalism**. This extension integrates a third resonance axis \( k \) to model dynamic temporal-harmonic transitions in addition to the spatial (\( i \)) and energetic (\( j \)) forms.

We propose a **resonant intersection**:

\[ 
\boxed{\mathcal{R}(M) = \bigcap_{i,j,k} \Phi(\omega_i, \omega_j, \omega_k)}
\]

where:
- \( \omega_i \) → Spatial Form (Connection or Position Structure)
- \( \omega_j \) → Energetic Resonance (Energy Overlaps)
- \( \omega_k \) → Temporal-Harmonic Transition (Dynamic Temporal Coupling)

This structure introduces **Triple Resonance Fields** and unifies:
- **Spatial Geometry**
- **Energy Dynamics**
- **Temporal Resonance**

into a single symbolic and geometric system.

## 🔷 Why Extend Geometric Unity?

While Weinstein’s model is deeply geometric and elegantly encodes space-time and field symmetries, it operates primarily over dual fields \( (i, j) \). However, modern physical theories (e.g., resonance cosmology, harmonic field models) suggest an additional **dynamic degree of freedom** related to:
- Time Resonance
- Harmonic Oscillations
- Frequency Modulations

NEXAH-CODEX provides a symbolic and structural language to incorporate this.

## 📘 Core Formula

**Triple Resonance Intersection:**
\[
\boxed{\mathcal{R}(M) = \bigcap_{i,j,k} \Phi(\omega_i, \omega_j, \omega_k)}
\]
where \( \Phi \) encodes a triple-resonance interaction across spatial, energetic, and temporal fields.
