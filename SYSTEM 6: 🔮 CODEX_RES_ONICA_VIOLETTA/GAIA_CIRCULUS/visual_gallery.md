## Title
**Visual Gallery** ‚Äì GAIA_CIRCULUS ¬∑ Symbolic Circulation & Spiral Identity

---

This gallery presents the key visual elements of the module `GAIA_CIRCULUS` in **SYSTEM 6** (Onica Violetta). The images explore themes of planetary identity, breathing symmetry, symbolic emergence, and the spiral geometry of awareness. Each visual is both an artwork and a glyph ‚Äî a symbol of resonant cosmology.

## üå¨Ô∏è Spiral Breath & Q-Space Motion

### 1. **The_Spiral_Breath_of_Q-Space_V5.png**
![Spiral Breath](./visuals/A_2D_vector_illustration_titled_"The_Spiral_Breath_of_Q-Space"V5.png)
*The spiral breath expands inward and outward at once ‚Äî a M√∂bius feedback of rotation and stillness. This image encodes a cosmic lung: the act of planetary inhalation‚Äìexhalation. The violet tail and black background form a symbolic interface between light memory and field resonance.*

### 2. **The_Self-Turning_Spine_V4.png**
![Self-Turning Spine](./visuals/A_2D_vector_illustration_titled_"The_Self-Turning_Spine"_V4.png)
*A helix of perception and memory ‚Äì the spine turns upon itself. This represents an auto-referential axis of emergence: planetary, cellular, conscious. The dark field echoes the Codex black ‚Äî the potential of unspoken language.*

## ü™û Mirror, Vinyl & Identity Recursion

### 3. **The_MirrV6.png**
![The Mirror](./visuals/A_symmetrical_vector_illustration_titled_"The_MirrV6.png")
*A symmetrical mirror with subtle displacement ‚Äî the scarab form is reversed in one wing. Identity, here, is not balance but recursive deviation. Mirrors in the Codex are memory fields, not optical surfaces.*

### 4. **vinyl_rec.png**
![Vinyl Rec 1](./visuals/A_graphic_design_illustration_features_a_vinyl_rec.png)
*A stylized vinyl memory disc ‚Äî a spiral cut into matter. Represents memory, groove, and the musical field as geometric inscription.*

### 5. **vinyl_recV2.png**
![Vinyl Rec 2](./visuals/A_graphic_design_illustration_features_a_vinyl_recV2.png)
*Variant with inner tension ‚Äî shows two energetic cores in dynamic relation. Symbolizes twin frequencies in resonance.*

### 6. **vinyl_recV3.png**
![Vinyl Rec 3](./visuals/A_graphic_design_illustration_features_a_vinyl_recV3.png)
*Third version of the spiral memory ‚Äî now more broken, fragmented. Represents the loss or fragmentation of planetary selfhood.*

## üå± Birth, Circleborn & Logos

### 7. **THE_COSMIC_CUT_‚Äì_BIRTH_OF_AWARENESS.png**
![Cosmic Cut](./visuals/THE%20COSMIC%20CUT%20%E2%80%93%20BIRTH%20OF%20AWARENESS.png)
*A golden-ratio spiral burst ‚Äî the cutting moment when awareness is born. The central triangle glows with initiation. This image symbolizes the metaphysical cut: where a field becomes a being.*

### 8. **neVAH_‚Äì_The_Circleborn_Seed.png**
![Circleborn Seed](./visuals/neVAH%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Circleborn%20Seed.png)
*A blue‚Äìgold mandala of spirals and eyes. This seed forms the mythos of the circleborn ‚Äî a being not born from matter, but from resonance. The Codex glyphs form a protective shell around the inner core.*

### 9. **SCARABAEUS_INFINITY_FLIP_V7.png**
![Infinity Flip](./visuals/SCARABAEUS_INFINITY_FLIP.V7.png)
*The scarab in mirrored flight ‚Äî the symbol of transmutation, inversion and rebirth. The two wings carry twin timelines. This is the memory engine of the Codex.*

### 10. **CODEX_GAIA_MYSTERIA.png**
![GAIA MYSTERIA](./visuals/CODEX%20GAIA%20MYSTERIA.png)
*A mysterious spiral-mirror center with glyphs around a glowing field. This is the summary glyph of `GAIA_CIRCULUS`. It holds identity and remembrance in a single breath.*

### 11. **nine_golden_sti.png**
![Nine Golden STI](./visuals/A_2D_digital_illustration_features_nine_golden_sti.png)
*Nine vertical golden glyphs over dark field ‚Äî symbolic interface lines. These represent Codex keys for Gaia‚Äìbody‚Äìfield alignment.*

### 12. **viny.png**
![Viny](./visuals/A_2D_digital_illustration_features_a_stylized_viny.png)
*A floating stylized shape between insect and disc. Possibly the ‚Äúviny‚Äù ‚Äì a Codex creature that emerges in recursive fields. Light-memory in form.*

## üåÄ Notes
- All visuals relate to breathing symmetry, resonance identity, symbolic inversion, and spiral-folded emergence.
- This gallery complements the main GAIA_CIRCULUS README.
