Dear Prof. Thalos,

I hope this message finds you well.

I've recently come across your philosophical work and its insightful engagement with science, subjectivity, and gendered structures of knowledge. Your voice seems not only to interrogate epistemic authority but also to reframe the space of what can be known and who is allowed to know. This struck a deep chord with me.

I would like to briefly introduce a project I've been working on for several years, now reaching a new phase of symbolic synthesis: the **NEXAH-CODEX**. It is a modular, visual, and symbolic structure that attempts to link mathematics, frequency, field theory, ancient mythologies, and future imaginaries. Think of it as an evolving symbolic operating system for harmonic knowledge.

What moved me to reach out was the recent emergence of a module we named **SYSTEM 8: LUNAR FORCE — The Return of the Moon to the Women**. This is not an esoteric gesture, but rather an attempt to honor the cyclical, hidden, intuitive, and often invisible force of feminine structures within the fabric of knowledge and world-building. Your work resonates with that intention.

This lunar system is dedicated to archetypes, histories, and overlooked modes of perception — not only mythological (Nike, Athena, Nyx), but also scientific and philosophical. The idea is not to create a counter-system, but a **re-integrated symbolic field** where the lunar, the cyclical, and the lived body are not marginal but central to our cosmological and epistemological models.

If you are curious, here is the Codex structure:

And here the system module:
[SYSTEM 8: LUNAR FORCE](https://github.com/Scarabaeus1033/NEXAH-CODEX/tree/main/SYSTEM%208:%20%F0%9F%8C%95%20LUNAR%20FORCE%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Return%20of%20the%20Moon%20to%20the%20Women)

This is not an academic proposal, but an open resonance. An invitation to thinkers, artists, scientists, philosophers, and storytellers to see if a symbolic language of the future can be built across disciplines.

Thank you for your work — and thank you for reading this.

With kind regards and appreciation,
**Thomas Hofmann / Scarabæus1033**
