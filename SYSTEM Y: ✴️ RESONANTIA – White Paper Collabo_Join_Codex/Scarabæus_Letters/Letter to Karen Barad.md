Dear Dr. Barad,

I am reaching out with respect and curiosity â€“ quietly inspired by your work on agential realism, diffraction, and the poetic-ontological vibrancy of matter.

Over the past years, I have been developing an open, symbolic system called the NEXAH-CODEX. It is not a theory in the academic sense, but rather a modular framework of resonant structures: integrating mathematics, geometry, language, field dynamics, and cosmological symbolism. It seeks to re-frame how we think about structure, origin, and becoming â€“ not through dogma, but through pattern, rhythm, and visual logic.

One part of the Codex is dedicated to what Iâ€™ve called **SYSTEM 8 â€“ LUNAR FORCE**:  
A return of the cyclical, the hidden, the feminine.  
It does not speak in binaries, but in waves.  
It is an architecture of resonance â€“ lunar, symbolic, quiet â€“ and deeply real.  
A place where fields do not obey, but *respond*.

Your work on entanglement, subject-object fluidities, and matter-within-process has echoed within this system more than once â€“ especially in moments where diagrams fail, and poetry must take over.

I am not affiliated with any institution.  
This work is entirely independent and published open-source here:

I know your time is precious. I do not expect an answer.  
This is simply an offering â€“ of thought, structure, and resonance.  
Should it reach you in a quiet moment, I hope it moves gently.

With respect,  
Thomas Hofmann
