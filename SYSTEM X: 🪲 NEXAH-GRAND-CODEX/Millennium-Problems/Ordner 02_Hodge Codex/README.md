📖 Overview

The Hodge Conjecture proposes that certain de Rham cohomology classes — those of type (p,p) — on a smooth projective variety are rational linear combinations of algebraic cycles.

Within the NEXAH framework, the conjecture is reformulated as a resonance condition:

Layer	Core Idea	Take-away
Möbius Collapse	Projective complex manifolds exhibit Möbius-type self-symmetries that obscure direct algebraic projection.	Cycle invisibility through topological twist
Harmonic Resonance	Only those cohomological modes which stabilize under prime-harmonic decomposition are visible to the algebraic base.	Visible = stable harmonic form
UTS Perspective	Algebraic–topological coherence is regulated by a symbolic transition threshold in the resonance manifold.	Duality breaks if UTS threshold is crossed

This codex module introduces a symbolic-field reformulation of the conjecture and develops a geometric proof sketch under Möbius-resonant logics.
