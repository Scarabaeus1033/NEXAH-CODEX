## 📘 Overview

This folder represents the **modular convergence point** for the NEXAH interpretation of the **Millennium Prize Problems** and **logical foundational structures** (notably Gödel). Each problem is treated not only as a mathematical challenge but as a **symbolic resonance test** within the tripartite NEXAH logic:

* **Möbius Compression** – topological feedback, loop stability, curvature
* **Harmonic Resonance** – frequency scaffolds, eigenmode analysis, damping structures
* **Universal Transition Structure (UTS)** – threshold logic, convergence architecture

This directory contains all **individual problem modules**, a **structural mapping file**, and cross-references to `dual_frameworks.md`, `universal_collapse_theorem.md`, and the central Codex Navigator.

## 🧠 Codex Philosophy

Rather than treating the problems as independent formal challenges, the Codex recognizes them as **interlinked resonance barriers** in a **coherence field**. These are not only mathematical boundaries, but symbolic mirrors of stability, logic, and transformation.

> "Every proof is a harmonic – every collapse, a Möbius turn."
