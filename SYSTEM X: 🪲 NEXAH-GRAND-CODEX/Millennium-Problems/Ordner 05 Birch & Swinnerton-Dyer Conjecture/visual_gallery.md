📘 Introduction

This visual gallery showcases the symbolic geometry and spectral dynamics underlying the Birch & Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture within the NEXAH-CODEX framework. Each diagram visualizes a different layer of resonance interpretation, from Möbius-torsion structures to L-function damping.

“Rational points are echoes of resonance held in symbolic tension.”

2. l_function_rank_gap.png

Caption: Spectral zero depth vs. algebraic rank
	•	L(E,s) near s = 1 plotted against resonance depth thresholds
	•	Visualizes how vanishing order correlates with harmonic visibility
