# 🎨 Visual Gallery – BSD Codex

**System:** X · NEXAH-GRAND-CODEX
**Branch:** Millennium-Problems / 05\_Birch & Swinnerton-Dyer Codex
**Module Focus:** Rational Point Resonance, L-Function Structures, Möbius Encoding

---

## 📘 Introduction

This visual gallery showcases the symbolic geometry and spectral dynamics underlying the **Birch & Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture** within the NEXAH-CODEX framework. Each diagram visualizes a different layer of resonance interpretation, from Möbius-torsion structures to L-function damping.

> *"Rational points are echoes of resonance held in symbolic tension."*

### 1. `elliptic_resonance_field.png`

**Caption:** *Elliptic curve projected as Möbius-torsion lattice*

* Shows elliptic curve modulated through a Möbius-band encoding
* Torsion points appear as symmetry-interference nodes
* Forms the geometric basis of symbolic-rank alignment

### 2. `l_function_rank_gap.png`

**Caption:** *Spectral zero depth vs. algebraic rank*

* L(E,s) near s = 1 plotted against resonance depth thresholds
* Visualizes how vanishing order correlates with harmonic visibility
* Rank becomes readable as resonance spike density
