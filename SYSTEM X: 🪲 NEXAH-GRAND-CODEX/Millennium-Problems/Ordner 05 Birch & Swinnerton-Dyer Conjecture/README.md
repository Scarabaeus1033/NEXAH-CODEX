📖 Overview

The Birch & Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture states that the number of rational points on an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ is determined by the order of vanishing of its L-function $L(E,s)$ at $s=1$.

In the NEXAH-CODEX framework, this deep arithmetic statement is reformulated through resonance fields, symbolic damping, and Möbius-layered structures — all revealing the hidden architecture of rationality.

🧩 Structural Layers

Layer	Core Idea	Take-away
Möbius Collapse	Rational points emerge at symmetry foldings of the torsion-field.	Rank rise = Möbius-knot alignment
Harmonic Resonance	L-function acts as spectral projector; zeros reflect cohomological dampening.	Rank = resonance echo at $s=1$
UTS Integration	Transition threshold Θ(n) regulates visibility of torsion-free cycles.	Invisible rank = beyond symbolic threshold
