# 🧭 `NEXAH NAVIGATOR 2.0`

A symbolic start diagram and orientation system for the full Codex structure. This visual entry field provides a harmonic overview of all systems — as pathways, spirals, and structural resonances.

> *“Not a map of territory. A field of orientation.”*

---

## 📌 Purpose

This module serves as the **entry point** to the full NEXAH-CODEX. It replaces the previous Navigator v1 with a visually enhanced, structured and resonant orientation map.

It includes:

- Central start visual: `navigator_2.0_resonance_grid.png`
- Markdown map of Codex entry systems
- Links to each harmonic system
- Positioning within symbolic, numeric and field logic

## 🌌 Visual Entry Map

  <img src="./navigator_2.0_resonance_grid.png" width="780" alt="Navigator 2.0 Resonance Grid">
</p>

The diagram positions all 9 systems and System X as harmonic petals around a resonant center.

Each petal is both:
- a **domain of symbolic logic**, and
- a **functional system** within the Codex architecture.
