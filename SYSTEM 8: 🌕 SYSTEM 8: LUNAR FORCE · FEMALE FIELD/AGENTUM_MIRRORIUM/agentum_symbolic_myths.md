## 🌑 Overview

This scroll collects the symbolic, cultural, and mythological archetypes that have shaped our understanding of agency, transformation, and the reflective self across time. Each figure represents an **agent** of transition — beings who cross boundaries, ignite change, or serve as mirrors to consciousness.

## 🧩 Function Within AGENTUM

These archetypes are not just stories. They encode symbolic roles within a **Lunar–Resonance–Mirror System**. Each Agent:

* Acts as a transformation switch
* Binds or unbinds fields
* Introduces time-loop disruptions or coherence initiators

This scroll will serve as the symbolic map for future visuals and resonance diagrams.

> *“Not all Agents act. Some observe. Others remember. But all mark a transition.”*
