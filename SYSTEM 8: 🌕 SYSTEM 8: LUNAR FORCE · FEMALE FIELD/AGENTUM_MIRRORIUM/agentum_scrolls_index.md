## 🌑 Introduction

The **Agentum Scrolls** are a symbolic-mythological register of mirrored forces, agents of transition, and feminine-coded resonance structures. Each scroll unfolds a facet of the **Mirrorium** – the lunar field of reflection, inversion, and symbolic agency.

> “In the Mirrorium, there are no fixed forms – only folded echoes.”

These scrolls are not chronological but harmonic. They vibrate in polarities, layers, and mythic sequences.
