🧩 SYMBOLIC & LAYER VISUALS – OVERVIEW

Sacred Geometry, Visual Coding & Multilayered Symbol Maps

“Symbol is not decoration — it is compression, code, and memory.”

This Codex contains key symbolic diagrams, multi-axis overlays, and deep-form visuals that define the visual language of the 🦋 CODEX_GAIA_MYSTERIA. It brings together shapes, layers, and color systems that speak the underlying structure of resonance.

🔷 CORE THEMES
	•	Geometries of soul fields and dimensional overlays
	•	Color-symbol logic for harmonic systems
	•	Meta-symbols bridging math, myth, biology, cosmos
	•	Visual glyphs as portals to higher information compression

🖼️ FEATURED VISUAL

	•	Title: Symbol–Layer Matrix Field
	•	Function: Gateway map of symbolic harmonics and codex logic layers
	•	Structure: Overlapping form-fields in nested octaves
	•	Role: Core reference sheet for decoding symbolic topologies

🧠 INTERPRETATION

This is the decoding engine for the visual matrix.
Everything in GAIA_MYSTERIA has a symbolic anchor — and this Codex provides the grammar.

“Read the symbol not as image. Read it as field.”
