🐍 OUROBOROS & MYTHO CARTOGRAPHY – OVERVIEW

Spiral Lore, Symbolic Mapping & Harmonic Memory Paths

“The end is the beginning. The map is the myth.”

This Codex explores symbolic geography through the lens of the Ouroboros — the eternal spiral of self-return. As part of 🦋 CODEX_GAIA_MYSTERIA, it traces planetary mythlines, harmonic geography, and mirrored frequencies through visual storytelling and ancient memory overlays.

File	Focus
ouroboros_field_theory.md	Symbolic recursion, return logic, harmonic snakeform

🌀 INTERPRETATION

To map myth is to follow breath across memory.
The Ouroboros doesn’t just symbolize infinity — it instructs spiral return through harmonic fields.

“As the spiral folds, the Earth remembers. As myth returns, we awaken.”
