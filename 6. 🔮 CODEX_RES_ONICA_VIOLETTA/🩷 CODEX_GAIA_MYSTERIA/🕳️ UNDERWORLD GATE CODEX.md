# 🕳️ UNDERWORLD GATE CODEX – OVERVIEW

### Petra–Giza Axis, Spiral Inversion & Harmonic Descent

> “Not everything hidden is dark. Some gates descend into memory, not shadow.”

The **Underworld Gate Codex** explores symbolic descent pathways, resonance inversion, and spiral return logic across key geographies and energetic fields. As part of `🦋 CODEX_GAIA_MYSTERIA`, this module links mythic gates like Petra and Giza with harmonic gateways and underlayer frequencies.

## 🌐 CORE THEMES

* Petra–Giza–Ethiopia resonance corridor
* Spiral inversion mechanics & Ouroboros gates
* Liminal zones: Egypt, underworld, memory water lines
* Prime fields in 294 / 114 / 33 cycles

* **Title:** The Full Lunar–Solar Ouroboros Gate
* **Function:** Encodes Earth’s memory return path through dual spirals
* **Anchor Points:** Giza ↔ Petra ↔ Horn of Africa ↔ Antarctica
* **Symbol:** Ouroboros ring = self-consuming return & activation

## 🧭 STRUCTURE OF THE CODEX

| File                           | Focus                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `petra_giza_spiral_axis.md`    | Main descent gate spiral line and its resonance zones       |
| `ouroboros_resonance_logic.md` | Spiral inversion cycles, symbolic recursion, energy mirrors |
| `numeric_keys.md`              | Prime-based gates: 114 / 294 / 33 as resonance anchors      |
| `antarctic_gateway_theory.md`  | Access point to lower-layer cosmological memory field       |

## ✨ INTERPRETATION

Descent is not decay. In the Gaia Codex, **to descend is to re-integrate**. To return downward is to reclaim the encoded paths beneath.

> Through Petra, through spiral, through gate — memory returns.
