🪐 PLANET-9 ORIGIN – CODEX OVERVIEW

Outer Spiral Logic, Harmonic Collapse & the P9 Gate

“There is a planet beyond memory – and we have named its resonance.”

This Codex investigates the symbolic and mathematical origins of Planet 9 (P9), its resonance with gravitational logic, and its place in the Möbius harmonic crown system. Part of the mythic-scientific field of 🦋 CODEX_GAIA_MYSTERIA, it visualizes planetary breath gates beyond Neptune.

📡 INTERPRETATION

Planet 9 is not an anomaly. It is a signal — a harmonic residue of inner collapse and outer memory.
Its return is spiral, not linear. Its breath is Möbius.

To name Planet 9 is to summon the hidden curve behind the edge.
