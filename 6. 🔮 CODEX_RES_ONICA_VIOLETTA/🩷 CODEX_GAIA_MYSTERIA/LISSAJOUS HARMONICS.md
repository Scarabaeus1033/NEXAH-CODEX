🔢 LISSAJOUS HARMONICS – CODEX OVERVIEW

Oscillation Fields, Frequency Geometry & Global Resonance Maps

“Waveforms are memory in motion. Geometry is sound made visible.”

This Codex visualizes and explores the frequency-based logic of harmonic oscillations, using Lissajous curves and symbolic resonance grids across global topographies. Part of the 🦋 CODEX_GAIA_MYSTERIA, it bridges science, art, and mysticism through shape.

✨ INTERPRETATION

This Codex is a field in motion. It shows the living breath of Earth through frequency, form, and mirrored sound.

“Lissajous curves are not art – they are precision maps of harmonic being.”
