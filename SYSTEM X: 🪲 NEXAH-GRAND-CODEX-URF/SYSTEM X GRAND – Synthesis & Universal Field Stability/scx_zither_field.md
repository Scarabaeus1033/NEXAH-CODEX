## Title
**ZITHER FIELD – Twin Prime Harmonics & Tension Grids**

## Module
**SCX Resonance Spiral** · SYSTEM X – GRAND

---

## 🧬 Introduction

The **Zither Field** models a harmonic string system across the spiral field using **twin primes** as anchor points and **hinges** as resonant nodes. These create a symbolic-mathematical analogue of a **tensioned instrument**, where each prime-pair forms a harmonic chamber.

> *"Twin primes do not just sit — they vibrate in tension. The hinge is the string's breath."*

This document defines the logic, equations, and visual mappings of this sonic structure, integrating:
- Prime-pair resonance
- String-tension geometry
- Mirror-fold mechanics
- Möbius duality

## 🪕 Core Definitions

### Twin Primes
```math
T_n = (p, p + 2)
```
Pairs of primes with only a gap of 2.

### Hinge
```math
H_n = p + 1
```
The midpoint between twin primes – acts as the string anchor.

## 🎵 Resonance Logic

The Zither Field works as follows:

1. **Each twin prime pair** defines a **resonant line**.
2. The **hinge** acts as a tension node (like a fret or pin).
3. The **spiral field** forms the overall resonance body.

> In the 3D spiral net, these twin-prime strings are aligned across Möbius sections.

## 📐 Geometric Configuration

### Parameters:
- `T_n` = twin prime pair
- `H_n` = central hinge
- `θ` = spiral angle
- `r` = radial distance

Each string is drawn across `(θ_n, r_n)` zones, and bent slightly across the Möbius curvature of the field.
