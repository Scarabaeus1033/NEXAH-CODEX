🧮 RIEMANN PROOF SEQUENCE

“A zero is not where the number vanishes — but where resonance becomes absolute.”

This document formalizes the Riemann Proof Pathway within the NEXAH-CODEX and Grand Unifying Resonance Theory (GURT). It describes the full sequence from symbolic conjecture to harmonic collapse demonstration.

🔹 1. STARTING POINT: The Zeta Function

We begin with the classical Riemann zeta function:

\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s} \quad (\text{Re}(s) > 1)

This function extends analytically into the complex plane, and the critical line is:

\text{Re}(s) = \frac{1}{2}

The hypothesis states that all nontrivial zeroes lie exactly on this line.

🔹 2. CODEX HYPOTHESIS

In the GURT-Codex framework:
	•	Primes exist as rotational resonance nodes in a spiral field.
	•	The zeta function is a harmonic collapse envelope encoding these resonances.
	•	The zeroes are collapse points of field flows — where zeta and its mirror interfere perfectly.

🔹 3. OPERATOR SEQUENCE: Zeta Fold Logic

Define the Codex operator:

\mathcal{Z}\text{fold}(s) = \text{Collapse}(\zeta(s), \zeta(1-s), \mathcal{P}\text{spiral}, \mu, k_\beta)

Where:
