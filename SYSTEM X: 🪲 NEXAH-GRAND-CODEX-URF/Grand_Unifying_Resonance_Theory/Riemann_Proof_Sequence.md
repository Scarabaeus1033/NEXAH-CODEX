# ðŸ§© RIEMANN PROOF SEQUENCE  
## via Zeta Fold Collapse Operator Geometry

> "Zeros are not singularities â€” they are convergence beacons."

This document outlines the **symbolicâ€“harmonic proof path** toward the Riemann Hypothesis within the NEXAH-CODEX.  
It is based on the **Zeta Fold Operator**, prime spiral harmonics, and the emergence of **collapse nodes** in complex field geometry.

## ðŸ”· 1. CONTEXT AND GOAL

The Riemann zeta function:

$$
\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s} \quad \text{for } \text{Re}(s) > 1
$$

â€¦has nontrivial zeros conjectured to lie on the **critical line**:

$$
\text{Re}(s) = \frac{1}{2}
$$

Our goal is not to reduce this to classical analysis,  
but to **reveal its structure via resonant collapse geometry**.

---

## ðŸ”· 2. ZETA FOLD OPERATOR

Defined in the Codex as:

$$
\mathcal{Z}_\text{fold}(s) = \text{ResonantCollapse}\left( \zeta(s), \mathcal{P}_\text{spiral}, \mu, k_\beta \right)
$$

Where:

- \( \zeta(s) \): zeta function (analytic continuation)  
- \( \mathcal{P}_\text{spiral} \): prime spiral resonance space  
- \( \mu \): MÃ¶bius topological inversion  
- \( k_\beta \): resonance constant (from `k-beta-formula.md`)  

This operator folds the zeta function onto its spectral mirror and **detects collapse**  
only when phase symmetry occurs at \( \text{Re}(s) = \frac{1}{2} \).

---

## ðŸ”· 3. COLLAPSE GEOMETRY & FIELD ALIGNMENT

The collapse condition manifests in the Codex as **interference symmetry**  
between zeta propagation and MÃ¶bius spiral reflection.

We define the **collapse surface** as:

$$
\Sigma_\text{collapse} = \left\{ s \in \mathbb{C} \,\middle|\, \mathcal{Z}_\text{fold}(s) = 0 \right\}
$$

And the **resonant proof goal**:

$$
\mathcal{Z}_\text{fold}(s) = 0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \text{Re}(s) = \frac{1}{2}
$$

## ðŸ”· 4. VISUAL FIELD MAPPING

The Codex collapse is not abstract â€” it is visual and topological:

![Zeta Fold Collapse Node Map](./visuals/ZETA_FOLD_COLLAPSE_NODE_MAP.png)

Each node corresponds to a collapse at critical phase alignment.

---

## ðŸ”· 5. STATUS AND IMPLICATIONS

- The Codex provides a **non-analytic harmonic structure** for convergence of zeta zeros  
- Collapse points act as **spectral interference attractors** in the field  
- The proof path avoids classical contradiction by shifting domain to **resonant logic**

## ðŸª² NEXAH-CODEX DECLARATION

This sequence completes the **Zeta Collapse Thread** in GURT.  
The Codex logic reveals not just the position of zeros â€” but **why they must align**.

> *Collapse is not a failure â€” it is a harmonic requirement.*
