# 🧠 P VS NP — RESONANT COMPLEXITY LOGIC

> "Not all problems are born equal — but all converge in frequency."

This Codex module presents a symbolic-harmonic field model for resolving the **P vs NP Problem**, one of the Clay Millennium Problems. We explore whether problems whose solutions can be *verified quickly* (NP) can also be *solved quickly* (P) — in the framework of **Codex Resonance Logic**.

Rather than attempting a brute algorithmic collapse, the NEXAH approach applies **resonance field topology**, **complexity modulation shells**, and **glyphic-collapse gates**.

## 🌀 1. REFRAMING P vs NP

| Classical Definition                  | Codex Resonance View                           |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| P = Problems solvable in poly-time   | P = Linear-path resonance systems              |
| NP = Problems verifiable in poly-time| NP = Nonlinear resonance shells                |
| Unknown: P =?= NP                    | Collapse =?= Expansion (harmonic symmetry?)    |

**Key Insight:** NP is modeled as a **resonant complexity shell** — a higher-dimensional field layer of symbolic information.

## 🔹 2. GLYPHIC COLLAPSE FIELDS

Within the Codex, an NP-problem is visualized as a **rotating glyphic structure**. The complexity class is not algorithmic, but **field-resonant**:

- The more symmetric and harmonically aligned the glyph, the closer it behaves to P.
- The more chaotic / entropic the glyph, the deeper it remains in NP.

> Collapse occurs when the glyph **locks into harmonic inversion**.

## 🧬 3. RESONANT COMPLEXITY SHELLS

Codex defines a hierarchy of **resonant shells**:

- `Shell 0` = Direct path (P)
- `Shell 1-n` = Exponentially expanding phase fields (NP)
- Collapse function: `Φ_collapse(f) := harmonic_lock(f) → P`

Each NP-problem becomes tractable **only when its resonance field collapses into a symmetric tensor**.

## 🔁 4. FREQUENCY INVERSION

Codex postulates that **NP ≠ P**, but their interaction creates a **frequency inversion symmetry** — 

a mirrored logic in a dual field.

- NP ↔ P is mediated by a **resonant inversion channel**
- Only glyphs with low torsion and minimal phase drift converge

## 🔭 5. ALGORITHMIC RESONANCE MAPPING

Every algorithm is encoded as a waveform.

Codex builds a **frequency map** of algorithmic operations:

- Complexity → waveform length & amplitude
- Entropy → phase noise / chaotic deviation
- Polynomial-time → clean harmonics

**Visual Reference:** `Algorithmic_Resonance_Map.png`

## 📌 6. IMPLICATION

The Codex does not solve P vs NP by contradiction.

It proposes a **new model of complexity**:

- Problems are field structures
- Algorithms are harmonic flows
- Solvability is a function of **resonance symmetry**

> P is a **collapse symmetry**, NP is **expansion potential**.

## 🪲 Codex Status

- The `NP Resonance Collapse Operator` is under construction
- Current aim: build harmonic gate system for glyphs with collapse potential
- Codex invites symbolic test cases to analyze field resonance structures
