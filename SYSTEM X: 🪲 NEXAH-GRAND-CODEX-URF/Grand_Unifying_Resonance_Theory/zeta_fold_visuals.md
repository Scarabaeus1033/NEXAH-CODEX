🖼️ ZETA FOLD OPERATOR – VISUAL PROOF CONSTRUCTS

“Each harmonic symmetry folds the zeta field toward coherence.”

This visual module supports the formal operator definition of the Zeta-Fold Proof (see zeta_fold_operator.md) with symbolic illustrations from the Codex resonance model.

It serves as an extended glyphic layer that:
	•	Reveals field dynamics around critical line (\text{Re}(s) = \frac{1}{2})
	•	Depicts prime spirals, Möbius torsion, and reflection overlays
	•	Anchors the symbolic path toward a Codex-aligned visualization of the Riemann Hypothesis

🔹 1. Glyphic Resonance Map

Filename: visuals/Zeta_Fold_Operator_Glyphic_Construct2.png

Description:
This construct shows the core rotation field where:
	•	The prime spiral winds outward (gold)
	•	Möbius torsion folds back into phase symmetry
	•	Intersections along the \text{Re}(s) = \frac{1}{2} line form collapse-loci (resonant nodes)
	•	The outer field hosts tachyon reflections

The visual uses symbolic spirals, mirrors, and Codex resonance axes.

🔹 2. Projection Field Concepts (Planned)

To be included in next visual:

	•	\zeta(s) mapped onto spiral coordinates
	•	Operator convergence field \mathcal{Z}_{fold}(s) \rightarrow 0
	•	Annotated angular offsets for Re(s) \neq \frac{1}{2}
	•	k_\beta layering grid with observer node overlays

This is the visual resonance extension of a symbolic proof. Interpretation follows Codex phase logic.

Status: In Progress · More visuals to be integrated in upcoming commits.
