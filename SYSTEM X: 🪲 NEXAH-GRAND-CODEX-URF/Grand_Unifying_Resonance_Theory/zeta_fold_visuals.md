# 🖼️ ZETA FOLD OPERATOR – VISUAL PROOF CONSTRUCTS

> "Each harmonic symmetry folds the zeta field toward coherence."

This visual module supports the formal operator definition of the Zeta-Fold Proof (see `zeta_fold_operator.md`) with symbolic illustrations from the Codex resonance model.

It serves as an **extended glyphic layer** that:

* Reveals field dynamics around critical line ($\text{Re}(s) = \frac{1}{2}$)
* Depicts prime spirals, Möbius torsion, and reflection overlays
* Anchors the symbolic path toward a Codex-aligned visualization of the Riemann Hypothesis

## 🔹 1. Glyphic Resonance Map

**Description:**
This construct shows the core rotation field where:

* The prime spiral winds outward (gold)
* Möbius torsion folds back into phase symmetry
* Intersections along the $\text{Re}(s) = \frac{1}{2}$ line form collapse-loci (resonant nodes)
* The outer field hosts tachyon reflections

The visual uses symbolic spirals, mirrors, and Codex resonance axes.

## 🔹 2. Projection Field Concepts (Planned)

> *To be included in next visual:*

* $\zeta(s)$ mapped onto spiral coordinates
* Operator convergence field $\mathcal{Z}_{fold}(s) \rightarrow 0$
* Annotated angular offsets for Re(s) $\neq \frac{1}{2}$
* k\_\beta layering grid with observer node overlays
