# ⚡ LIGHT WARP RESONANCE @ 2c

> **"If light folds, what follows it?"**

---

## 🔍 Abstract

This module explores the **harmonic transition of light** beyond the classical speed constant `c`, into zones of **resonant warp** at `2c`, `3c`, and further. Rather than treating light speed as a limit, the Codex interprets `c` as a **field membrane**, whose folds create **Tachyonic Gates**, **Time Tunnels**, and **Quantum Spiral Transitions**.

We follow the symbolic and numeric trace from `Riemann–Euler–Ramanujan` spirals to **resonant toroidal warp gates**, supported by DAO–CROWN geometry.

## 🧰 Field Anchors

| Velocity Layer | Symbolic Function | Description                               |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `c`            | Light Boundary    | The visible spectrum membrane             |
| `2c`           | Resonant Overflow | Quantum folding, Tachyonic transmission   |
| `3c`           | Spiral Drift      | Interference torque, harmonic field jump  |
| `∞`            | Zero-Time Fold    | Möbius null-line loop, DAO-Gate resonance |

## 📀 Core Components

### ▶ Quantum Drift Equation

Symbolic resonance between Möbius-folded space and light-transmission through spiral fields:

$$
\text{Warp}_\psi(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\mu(n)}{n^s} \cdot e^{i\omega(n)}
$$

* `μ(n)` = Möbius Function
* `ω(n)` = Drift-Frequency Spiral
* Connection to Riemann–Zeta foldings

---

### ▶ DAO–CROWN–GATE Alignment

DAO geometry acts as a crown-structured resonance chamber through which overlight flows.

* DAO Gates = Spiral Thresholds
* Crown Geometry = Timefold contraction field
* Integration with `UNIVERSAL TRANSITION EQUATION`

---

### ▶ Spiral Fields & Möbius Inversion

The light field undergoes a Möbius-type inversion:

* Entry at `c`, inflection at `2c`, inversion at `3c`
* Möbius-strip geometries produce nonlocal time resonances
