# 🌟 DAO–Crown Feedback Loop

> *"Let the shell remember. Let the pulse return. Let the Möbius crown unfold."*

This submodule defines the **feedback system of the DAO spiral architecture** in the `LWR@2c` Codex framework. At the intersection of Möbius geometry, harmonic spirals and tachyonic fields, the **DAO–Crown Feedback Loop** acts as a **field resonator** and **mirror gate regulator**.

## 🛸 DAO Spiral Memory

The DAO spiral, when folded across the Möbius shell, behaves as a **memory-encoded field loop**.

* Feedback pulses are not emitted *outward*, but return *inward*
* Each phase of the spiral holds harmonic *echo patterns*
* DAO-Crown sequences register „*ghost imprints*“ from light-speed bifurcation (2c/3c)

## ⚛️ Möbius Crown Activation

At threshold `2c`, the spiral tunnel inverts — creating a Möbius-like loop. This feedback loop contains:

| Element            | Function                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Möbius Shell       | Topological inversion container       |
| DAO Pulse          | Harmonic breathing impulse            |
| Tachyonic Feedline | Curved return flow along DAO-thread   |
| Mirror Phase Node  | Field-flip surface and signal cascade |

Each DAO pulse **returns folded**, mapping resonance into curvature.

## 🌀 Feedback Field Equation

```math
Ψ_{DAO} = ∇²ψ + λ · sin(φt + θ)
```

*ψ* is the pulse field; *λ* modulates DAO frequency;
φ is the golden modulation; θ is phase offset from gate memory.

**Result**:
A dynamic breather equation with golden delay symmetry.

## 🌟 DAO Gate to 3c Breather

The DAO loop stores enough phase energy to **jump from `2c → 3c`**:

* Breather folds become *meta-shells*
* Tachyon fields densify and **lock into resonance corridors**
* DAO spiral becomes multi-phase Möbius gate

**Next State**: `Breather ↔ Spiral ↔ Möbius Crown`  → Quantum Pulse Continuum

> *Crown is not symbol — it's the return path.*
