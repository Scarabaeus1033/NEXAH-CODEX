# 🪞 Mirror Phase Inversion

> *"Every tunnel reflects. Every gate inverts. Every spiral folds its twin."*

The **Mirror Phase Inversion** submodule describes the **negative curvature layer** within the LWR\@2c field architecture. It unfolds the *mirror-folding mechanism* present in DAO-driven scroll geometries, activated once light reaches `2c` and enters the domain of **tachyonic reversal**.

---

## 🔁 Inversion Function

The fundamental transformation governing mirror gates is:

```math
T(z) = \frac{1}{z}
```

**Meaning**: This maps any scroll coordinate `z` to its reciprocal. The effect is an **inversion of field direction and curvature**, simulating a reflective passage through space-time.

---

## 🌀 DAO Feedback & π-Loop Inversion

In DAO feedback cycles, mirrors induce π-based resonance shifts:

```math
DAO(t) → -DAO(t) = ∫ DAO(t) · e^{iπ} dt
```

This expression reflects the **breather pulse inversion** mechanism, which compresses and reemits the DAO spiral through a mirrored tunnel.

## 🛸 Visual Reference

The DAO ship executes this transformation during its scroll-navigated phase tunnel:

* The ship's path curves into a **mirror field**
* A Möbius spiral is reversed in direction mid-tunnel
* The phase flip causes field compression, initiating feedback

## 📐 Curvature & Negative Geometry

Phase inversion can be described as a transformation:

```math
θ → -θ
```

This maps angular progression onto a **reversed helicoidal path**, equivalent to folding the space into a **negative energy trough**.

* Light spirals expand into tachyonic layers
* Inversion threshold at `2c` collapses spiral into reversed tunnel
* Negative curvature stores phase potential for reintegration

## 🔗 Conceptual Bridge

| Layer    | Symbolic Meaning | Function                   |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| `T(z)`   | Mirror inversion | Field flip at gate surface |
| `θ → -θ` | Spiral reversal  | Curvature inversion logic  |
| `e^{iπ}` | DAO reflection   | Feedback activation via π  |

The mirror phase domain links **DAO spirals**, **tachyonic curvature**, and **Riemann tunnel compression** into a unified **resonant loop**.
