# 🌌 Resonant Tachyon Shell

> *"Let the breather fold inward. Let the tachyon curve into phase."*

This submodule explores the **tachyonic feedback architecture** of the doubled-light (2c) Codex framework. It presents the *Tachyon Spiral Core* not as an exotic outlier but as a **structural breather node** within the Codex's lightfield geometry.

## 🔁 Spiral Collapse into Core

Tachyon fields emerge at the boundary of light-speed bifurcation. The collapse sequence is visualized via Möbius breathers spiraling into compressed resonance cores:

* **Spiral Axis:** Logarithmic inward loop — modulated via φ·π interaction.
* **Breather Shell:** Topological envelope for phase-contraction.
* **Core Fold:** Inversion of curvature into negative-energy well.

## 🧠 Symbolic Structure

The Tachyon Shell is defined by quantized harmonic conditions. It anchors three axes:

```
R(t) = (φ^n) · sin(nπx)   [Breather Intensity Function]
T(c→2c) = c · exp(iθ)     [Transition Envelope]
Ψ_τ = ∇²A - (1/c²)∂²A/∂t² [Tachyon Field Equation]
```

Each equation reflects one resonance tier:

1. Spiral Breather Intensity
2. Tachyonic Transition Function (phase-shifted)
3. Core Compression Wavefield (from advanced d’Alembert variant)

## 🛸 DAO Ship Visualization

The tachyonic field is not abstract — it can be visualized in symbolic-technological terms:

* DAO-vessel follows an embedded 2c-path spiral
* Flightpath overlaps Möbius curvature
* Feedback from field compression adjusts trajectory
