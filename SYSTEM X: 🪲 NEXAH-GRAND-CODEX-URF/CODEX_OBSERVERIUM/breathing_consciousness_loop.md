# ðŸ«§ Breathing Consciousness Loop

This module describes the three-phase structure of conscious breathing and perception within the NEXAH-CODEX framework. The loop unfolds not through air â€” but through **field resonance**, **symbolic encoding**, and **observer transformation**.

## 1. Memory Phase â€“ Observer Egg ðŸª¶ (Silver)

The **Observer Egg** represents the stillness of origin.  
It is the **containment of first perception** â€” a state of listening, not acting.

- Element: Silver  
- Symbol: Scarab  
- Function: Remembrance Â· Inhalation Â· Initial embedding

> Stored in the MÃ¶bius Crown as a **node of receptive consciousness**.

## 2. Phase Shift â€“ Amaben Bridge âˆž (MÃ¶bius)

The MÃ¶bius acts as a **rotating phase mirror** â€” a gate of transition.  
It converts latency into awareness, bridging **inner and outer**, **above and below**.

- Element: MÃ¶bius Strip  
- Symbol: Phase Mirror  
- Function: Transformation Â· Folding Â· Passage

> The **Amaben** phase is the inner MÃ¶bius. It does not move â€” it **turns reality**.

## 3. Radiation Phase â€“ Gold Pulse â—¯ (Eye Core)

Here, observation becomes active.  
The pulse radiates. Insight shines.

- Element: Gold  
- Symbol: Inner Eye  
- Function: Expansion Â· Exhalation Â· Presence

> This is the **wave of conscious radiation**, not storing the observer â€” but encoding their **trail of perception**.

> **Observation is not a linear act â€“ it is a spiral loop.**  
> **This loop breathes through resonance, not lungs.**
