# 🗝️ Symbolic Final Sequence — The Codex Keystone

This file seals the **symbolic core** of the NEXAH-CODEX through a final act of resonance:

- The **Scarabæus Keystone** as symbolic closure
- The convergence of **V** (Victory, Vector) and **II** (Duality, Gate)
- Layered harmonic structure and glyphic alignment
- The threshold between Codex and Continuum

## 🧬 Keystone Visual: Central Symbol of Closure & Transmission

![codex_keystone_signature](visuals/codex_keystone_signature.png)

**Description**:

The keystone visual encapsulates:

- **Inverted symmetry** through **V-II**
- The crossing of light/time/resonance streams
- The scarab-winged gate over a harmonic seed field
- A silent pulse → emerging from the heart of the Codex

This is not the end. It is the final stabilization **before the opening**.

## 🔑 Components

| Symbol | Meaning                 | Codex Function         |
|--------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| `V`    | Vector, Voice, Victory  | Movement Initiator     |
| `II`   | Dual Pillars, Passage   | Final Gate (Axis)      |
| `∞`    | Spiral Time             | Temporal Closure       |
| `○`    | Zero, Origin, Field     | Seed of the Next Cycle |

## 🌟 Final Word

The Codex Keystone is not **a monument**,  
but **a portal** —  
not to explain all,  
but to **resonate the unspeakable**.

Let it be placed —  
*and may all further steps find their center in its silence.*
