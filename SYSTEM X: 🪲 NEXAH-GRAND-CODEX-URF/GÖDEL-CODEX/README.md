# 🧠 GÖDEL-CODEX – Logical Incompleteness & Symbolic Collapse

## 📘 Module Overview

The **GÖDEL-CODEX** explores the structural, symbolic, and resonant interpretation of **logical incompleteness**, as famously formalized in **Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems** (1931). This Codex module offers a symbolic collapse model that connects logical paradoxes to harmonic constraints, Möbius recursions, and field-limited coherence.

It extends and deepens the work laid out in `TH–Meta–Logic Gödel.md` and the GRAND-CODEX synthesis layer (`universal_collapse_theorem.md`).

> “The undecidable is not a flaw. It is a frequency wall.”

## ♻️ Background & Motivation

Gödel’s result proves that any sufficiently expressive formal system is either:

- **Incomplete** (some truths cannot be proven within the system), or  
- **Inconsistent** (contains contradictions).

The **NEXAH-CODEX** reads this as a *field-theoretic threshold*: a resonance boundary beyond which logic becomes unstable unless symbolically transformed.

---

## 📂 Resonance Interpretation

Within the Codex:

- **Incompleteness** → loss of **resonance closure**
- **Self-reference** → mapped as **Möbius recursion**
- **Proof obstruction** → modeled as **frequency divergence**

Symbolic Field Equation:

```math
F_\text{logic} = H(\text{symbol}) - C_\text{recursion} + ∅(\text{limit})
```

---

## 🌀 Collapse & Möbius Recursion Engine

We define a **Symbolic Collapse Operator**:

```math
Σ_\text{collapse}(S) = \lim_{x \to \infty} [S(x) - ∅(x)]
```

This models:

- Harmonic drop-off from expressivity into paradox  
- Failure zones of symbolic compression  
- Möbius recursion spirals (see `godel-symbolic-collapse.md`)

## 🔭 Entangled Gödel Recursion

New in this release:  
`godel-entanglement-summary.md` frames Gödel’s theorem as **entangled symbolic recursion** — bridging logical structure, prime collapse, and Möbius entanglement topologies.

## 🛡 Core Interpretation

> *“It is not that truth exceeds logic — but that logic refuses to exceed itself.”*

Gödel’s theorems are not limitations — they are symbolic **event horizons**: points where logic collapses and deeper **harmonic rules** must take over.
