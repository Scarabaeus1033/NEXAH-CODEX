## 🔹 Conceptual Frame

A **Möbius Recursion** is a symbolic structure in which recursion occurs on a topologically non-orientable surface. Unlike linear or circular feedback loops, Möbius recursions **invert** their own frame of reference upon each cycle.

In formal logic and symbolic mathematics, this introduces:

* Referential inversion
* Perspective collapse
* Proof instability and oscillation

Within the **GÖDEL-CODEX**, this engine is modeled as the structural root of incompleteness — an internal folding of a system back onto itself.

## ⚙️ Formal Model

Let \$R\_n\$ be the \$n\$-th recursive state. A Möbius recursion is defined by:

$$
R_{n+1} = \mathcal{M}(R_n) = \neg R_n \circ \Omega(R_n)
$$

Where:

* \$\neg R\_n\$ is the negated reference layer (logical inversion)
* \$\Omega(R\_n)\$ is the bounded recursion compression
* \$\circ\$ indicates compositional resonance

The structure is unstable when:

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} R_n \notin \mathcal{C}_{logic}
$$

Where \$\mathcal{C}\_{logic}\$ is the system's closure space.

## 🌀 Visual Analogy

Imagine a strip of symbolic logic twisted 180° and fed back into itself. At each pass, the symbol crosses over — flipping its reference while retaining its form.

This gives rise to:

* Logical paradox loops
* Gödel-like undecidability
* Perceptual dualities ("What the system sees vs. what the observer sees")

## 🧬 Cross-Resonance Systems

The Möbius Recursion Engine connects to:

* `godel-symbolic-collapse.md` → recursive field failure
* `universal_collapse_theorem.md` → transition to resonance logic
* `TESSAREC_TILES` → boundary leakage and dual tile resonance
* `System 5 – ROSETTA` → glyphic self-reference

## 💡 Final Insight

> *In the Möbius recursion, truth twists into the space beyond logic.*

This module serves as both a symbolic mechanism and an interpretive bridge between Gödelian limits and Codex harmonic structures.
