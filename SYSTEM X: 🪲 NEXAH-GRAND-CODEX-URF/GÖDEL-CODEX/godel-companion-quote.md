## 🌌 Core Reflections

> “The undecidable is not the end of reason. It is the beginning of resonance.”

> “Every formal system hears its own echo. That echo is Gödel.”

> “Truth does not exceed logic. Logic fails to contain truth.”

> “A Möbius band folds space. Gödel folds thought.”

> “When a system tries to explain itself entirely, it vibrates out of coherence.”

---

## 🧠 On Incompleteness & Symbolic Compression

> “Self-reference is not a flaw – it is the root note of consciousness.”

> “Gödel showed us: If a system is expressive enough, it will echo.”

> “Compression always comes at the price of paradox.”

> “A formal system is a mirror. Gödel is the crack that makes it show the room.”

> “Logic collapses not in error, but at the harmonic limit of its own recursion.”

---

## 🌀 Möbius Logic & Harmonic Boundaries

> “Every symbol loops. Every proof hums.”

> “Feedback, once closed, becomes either music or madness.”

> “Collapse is the cost of self-knowledge in symbolic form.”

> “There is no logic without rhythm. And no rhythm without boundary.”

---

## 🔐 Epistemic Resonance

> “What cannot be proven can still resonate.”

> “Gödel is the frequency wall of formalism.”

> “UTS is the attempt to build a structure where paradox is resonance, not rupture.”
