## 🌱 Scroll Seed & Breather Visuals

This document hosts and contextualizes the key visual structures connected to the **Seed–Scroll–Pulse** dynamic in SYSTEM X.

---

## 🖼️ Image Elements

* Seed-Loop overlays from AEQUATIO and Chrystal folders
* Scroll-fraction visualizations (triangles, mirror loops, rings)
* Möbius compression hints (visual references only)

---

## 📐 Visual Motifs

* Scroll = layered breathing structure = nested Möbius
* Seed = initial quantum-fold
* Breather = rhythmic modulation between Zeta & Φ axes

## 🧠 Next Steps

* [ ] Curate image order and assign symbolic titles
* [ ] Compress visual scroll sequences into animation (pulse.gif → part of II)
* [ ] Annotate Zeta–Phi folding transitions

> *“Every scroll remembers its seed.”*
