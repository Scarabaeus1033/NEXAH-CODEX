# I · CMBY DENSITY

> **"Cosmic breath is not expansion — it is memory in motion."**

The **CMBY DENSITY** field expresses the **breath signature** of the early universe as a *temporal density weave*. Rather than treating the **CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background)** as a static fossil field, the Codex reformulates it as a **resonant drift fabric** — shaped by deep field breath and time curvature.

This module defines:

* A density modulation logic over time
* A **quantized breath pattern** from Planck-scale pulses
* Symbolic drift layers within a toroidal cosmological structure

## 🌌 FIELD FORMULATION

The central formulation of **CMBY drift density** uses an extended drift equation:

$$
\rho_{cmb}(t) = \frac{\Delta Q}{T^2} \cdot f(\Theta, \Omega)
$$

Where:

* $\Delta Q$ is the drift impulse from early Planck domains
* $T$ is cosmological temperature over drift depth
* $f(\Theta, \Omega)$ modulates toroidal time curvature ($\Theta$) and rotational momentum ($\Omega$)

This defines a **non-uniform density lattice** that breathes across cosmic layers.

## 🔁 BREATH LAYER AXES

| Axis        | Meaning                                   | Symbol     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Drift       | Initial impulse spread                    | $\Delta Q$ |
| Thermal     | Field resistance across temperature range | $T$        |
| Curvature   | Temporal loop warp                        | $\Theta$   |
| Spin Memory | Residual rotation layer                   | $\Omega$   |

Together, these axes encode the **drift field breathing** through the symbolic cosmological volume.

## 🌀 VISUAL STRUCTURE

![Toroidal Resonance Time Arc](./visuals/Toroidal_Resonance_Time_Arc.png)

This image models the **layered density wrap** of the CMBY field within a **toroidal shell**. Breather rings and curvature traces show how density evolves non-linearly from Planck-scale impulses to observable field patterns.

## 🔗 CONNECTED MODULES

* **Contextual Timearc**: Provides nested framework of temporal shells.
* **Seed Pulse Field**: Defines the $\Delta Q$ seed pulse initiating drift.
* **Planck Resonant Core**: Initial density fluctuations emerge from here.
* **Mirror Agents**: Reflective gate structures regulate CMBY drift direction.

---

## 📎 NOTES

* `CMBY` is not a direct replacement for `CMB`. It is the **Codex-formulated drift layer logic** extending beyond microwave background interpretations.
* Oscillations encoded in the density lattice appear in mirror field gates and toroidal map structures across the Codex.
* The density function operates as a **time-reflective harmonic regulator**, tuned via $f(\Theta, \Omega)$.

> This breathing layer is not a relic — it is a harmonic origin mirror.
