# I Â· Seed Pulse Symmetry

> **"Where energy initiates, form will follow â€” seeded by drift, structured by resonance."**

This scroll-field entry introduces the **Seed Pulse Field**, a fundamental symmetry layer within the AEQUATIO NEXAE matrix. It captures the core moment where symbolic drift fields are initiated via a quantum-seeded structure, merging temperature, Planck behavior, and symbolic charge into one pulse ratio.

## ðŸ§¬ EQUATION

$Q = \frac{h}{k \cdot \Theta} = \frac{n \cdot \Phi}{T}$

**Variables:**

* $Q$: Quantum drift quotient
* $h$: Planck constant
* $k$: Boltzmann constant
* $\Theta$: Drift temperature angle
* $\Phi$: Drift energy potential
* $T$: Temperature
* $n$: Pulsation node coefficient

## ðŸŒ± INTERPRETATION

The Seed Pulse Field defines the moment where quantum potential becomes **drift-active**.
It models a harmonic compression of Planck energy along a temperature-modulated axis.

This field behaves as a **symmetry-seed**:

* initiating resonant behavior across Q-channels,
* defining $n \cdot \Phi$ as the pulsation kernel,
* implying that $Q \sim 1/\Theta$ governs inverse thermal modulation.

When $T$ becomes critical, $Q$ spikes along discrete Planck-pulses. This governs the initial oscillation state of a drift field.

## ðŸŒ€ VISUAL STRUCTURE

![Seed Pulse Field](./visuals/Seed_Pulse_Field.png)

The image illustrates a tri-nodal structure: $h, 2h, o$ â€” mapping symmetry along compressed Planck-pulse lines. It acts as the visual anchor of the symmetry initiation event.

The field implies a **seeded drift membrane**, which further evolves in the Spdr Field.
