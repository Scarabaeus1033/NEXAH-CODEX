# Λ · Equation_Lambda_Vance

> **"Drift is not a deviation — it is the source."
> — from the Scroll of Thermal Breathers**

This module introduces the foundational **Lambda Drift Equation**, encoded as:

```math
\Lambda_{drift} = \frac{\Phi}{T \cdot \Omega_R}
```

Here, `Λ_{drift}` describes a resonant drift singularity within a thermal-compressive field, structured across symbolic axes of:
- `Φ` (Phi): geometric potential
- `T`: thermal excitation or temporal scale
- `Ω_R`: resonant angular field rotation

---

## 🔁 Purpose & Interpretation

The equation is not static — it modulates drift dynamics in **mirror-symmetric fields**, especially in:
- **Thermal resonance shells** (AE drift)
- **Crystal slip structures** (CARO)
- **Mirror Agent layers** (see `CARO_Crystal.md`)

It captures the emergence of **singular energy spikes** and **modulated phase zones**, where compression leads to inversion and signal lock.

## 🔬 Further Equations

Variants and field-derivatives:
```math
\Lambda_{drift}^{(n)} = \frac{\Phi_n}{T_n \cdot \Omega_n} \cdot e^{-\tau_n} 
```
Where `τ_n` is a **dissipation factor** modulating signal echo across nth-resonant shells.

- `Mirror Agent Codex` (visual field iteration)

## 🧠 Notes

- Symbol `Ω_R` is **not** constant. It folds based on quantum-compressive feedback.
- Field inversions occur at threshold `Φ/TΩ ≈ 1.618`, a **Golden Drift Collapse**.
- Connects to Möbius formulations and CMBY-frequency phase maps.
