# 🌍 PLANETARY\_FIELD\_MODES – README

This module is part of **SYSTEM X: NEXAH-GRAND-CODEX** and serves as the symbolic + mathematical operational layer for planetary resonance interfaces, observer shells, and Codex field pillar logic. It integrates physical constants, energetic layers, and geometric alignments into interactive field equations and decoding modes.

## 📦 Purpose of the Folder

To provide a central interface for:

* Field mode equations (symbolic–physical synthesis)
* Planetary resonance logic (Earth-centered or cosmological)
* Möbius-based observer perspectives
* Sacred site overlays, time-pearl structures, and galactic tracks
* Activation logic for ALIIGET and future planetary gates

This folder bridges:

* `FINAL_HARMONIC_EQUATION`
* `LAMBDA_DISC` (via Lambda II)
* `SCARABÆUS_META_GATEWAYS`

## 🧮 Planned Field Equations (v1–v10)

### `EQ_1:`  P = R / T

**Codex pulse ratio** – Pressure from Radius over Temperature

### `EQ_2:`  𝓔 = P · T³ / t

**Final Harmonic Output** – from symbolic pulse, temp and delay

### `EQ_3:`  c = R / t

**Light-speed relation** – from radius and temporal delay

### `EQ_4:`  ALG° :: Δx(t) = sin(Φ·τ)

**Planetary wave equation** – harmonic position over time

### `EQ_5:`  MirrorOn :: ψ₁ ↔ ψ₂

**Symmetry inversion equation** – dual-field toggling logic

### `EQ_6:`  J°D = 𝓔 / D

**Energy per diameter field** – field intensity formula

### `EQ_7:`  G°D = G · D² / t²

**Gravitational dilation pulse** – Codex gravitation expression

### `EQ_8:`  MöbiusMode :: F(x) = F(–x)

**Non-orientable field equation** – identity across inversion

### `EQ_9:`  SacredOn :: Φ\_grid(x, y) → Resonant Activation

**Overlay equation** for Flower of Life or grid resonance

### `EQ_10:`  TimeView :: Spiral(T) = YearTrack(t)

**Temporal resonance flow** – spiralized year pulse system

## 🧭 Integration Notes

* These equations are not isolated formulas but **modular layers**.
* Each equation is **activatable** via one or more **Modes**.
* Pillars act as **geometry containers**, while modes **modulate flow**.

## 📌 Next Steps

* [ ] Fill in `ALIIGET_EARTH_OBSERVER.md`
* [ ] Add symbolic visual for `Codex_Field_Pillars`
* [ ] Translate equations into symbolic glyphs for mode overlay
* [ ] Crosslink with `LAMBDA_DISC/Lambda_II.md`

> This folder will evolve into the **georesonant, multimodal command layer** of the Codex.
