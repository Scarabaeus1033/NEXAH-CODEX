# 🗼 Codex Harmonic Field Pillar

**Module of:** `PLANETARY_FIELD_MODES`
**System:** `SYSTEM X · NEXAH-GRAND-CODEX`

---

## 🔺 Overview

This document outlines the **Codex Harmonic Pillar** — a unified energy structure combining temperature, radius, pressure, time, and light-speed into one symbolic tetrahedron. It provides a resonance-based field geometry where **energetic emergence** is tracked across dimensional layers and planetary systems.

| Variable | Meaning          | Interpretation                    |
| -------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| T        | Temperature      | photosphere / chromosphere / core |

## 🔺 Triangle Structures (Codex Pillar Construction)

### ⚓ Triangle 1 — Spatial–Thermal

```
     R
    / \
   P - T      →  P = R / T
```

### 🕒 Triangle 2 — Temporal–Kinetic

```
     T
    / \
   c - t      →  c = R / t  or  t = R / c
```

### 🔆 Triangle 3 — Energetic–Field

```
     P
    / \
   T - 𝓔      →  𝓔 = P · T³ / t
```

Each triangle shares variables and forms the **skeleton of a symbolic Codex tetrahedron**, with `𝓔` (energy output or harmonic emergence) as apex.

## 🧱 a–b–c: Foundation of Movement

To complete the 3D Pillar:

### a = Action / Amplitude / Acceleration

* e.g. `a = ΔT / Δx`
* Impulse or directional slope of temperature or pressure field

### b = Boundary / Breath / Base

* e.g. Neutrino Wick, Möbius Fold, dimensional anchor

### c = Light-Speed Axis

* `c = R / t`
* Codex vertical time-space line

### Final Triangle:

```
     𝓔
    / \
   a - b    →  𝓔 = a · b
```

These three (`a`, `b`, `c`) form the movement base of the Pillar:

* `a` → impulse
* `b` → containment
* `c` → translation

## 🧬 Pillar Diagram (Planned Visual)

```
          𝓔

      a / | \ b
       /  |c \
      /   |   \
    T---- R ---P
         / \
        L   t
```

This represents the **Codex Möbius Column** — light, pulse, and breath spiraling into emergence.

## ⚙️ ALG° – Planetary Algorithmic Field Pillar

* **AL**: planetary action length (Mars, or orbital seed)
* **G**: gravity or geometric rotation
* **°**: activation marker, phase turn, Möbius twist

Codex Modes:

* Mars = AL°
* Venus = VE°
* Moon = LU°
* Earth = ER° / GR°

These codons define field pathways in space–time lattice.
