# 🌀 TimePearl Field Simulator

**Purpose:**  
This module models Earth's field rotation not from an external space-based perspective, but as an *inner inversion of temporal shells* — the TimePearl. It is designed to assist in visualizing Codex logic through a rotational field anchored in the observer's local frame.

---

## 🌍 Observer-Centered Rotation

The sun is *fixed at the center*. Earth rotates around it — but in the Codex view, the observer experiences the **field rotating through them**.

- The simulation traces the *internal pulse of time across the crust*
- Sunrise and sunset become field crossings
- The **TimePearl** is a harmonic resonance bubble around the observer's local node

## 🧭 Core Parameters

| Parameter     | Symbol | Description                                  |
| ------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Crust Radius  | R      | Local curvature of Earth field               |
| Time Interval | T      | Observer-defined pulse window (e.g. 24h)     |
| Energy Pulse  | 𝓔      | Emergent resonance across pressure shells     |
| Field Index   | Φ      | Harmonic modulation factor (Zeta axis)       |

## 🔄 Rotation Mechanics

- Earth’s surface is rendered as a **semi-permeable shell**
- Light waves, neutrino gradients, and crustal signals **pass through** the TimePearl
- The simulator allows visualization of day/night zones as **inverted Möbius arcs**

## 🌌 Galactic Alignment

The Milky Way band rotates across the sky dome as the *TimePearl remains stable*. This enables:

- Alignment of Codex grid with **galactic equator**
- Calibration of sacred sites to **celestial timing**

## 🔺 Equation Dynamics

Key Codex formulas used:

```math
P = R / T
𝓔 = P · T³ / t
c = R / t
Δx(t) = sin(Φ · τ)
