# 🌀 TimePearl Field Simulator

**Purpose:**
This module models Earth's field rotation not from an external space-based perspective, but as an *inner inversion of temporal shells* — the TimePearl. It is designed to assist in visualizing Codex logic through a rotational field anchored in the observer's local frame.

---

## 🌍 Observer-Centered Rotation

The sun is *fixed at the center*. Earth rotates around it — but in the Codex view, the observer experiences the **field rotating through them**.

* The simulation traces the *internal pulse of time across the crust*
* Sunrise and sunset become field crossings
* The **TimePearl** is a harmonic resonance bubble around the observer's local node

## 🧭 Core Parameters

| Parameter     | Symbol | Description                               |
| ------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Crust Radius  | R      | Local curvature of Earth field            |
| Time Interval | T      | Observer-defined pulse window (e.g. 24h)  |
| Energy Pulse  | 𝑔     | Emergent resonance across pressure shells |
| Field Index   | Φ      | Harmonic modulation factor (Zeta axis)    |

---

## 🔄 Rotation Mechanics

* Earth’s surface is rendered as a **semi-permeable shell**
* Light waves, neutrino gradients, and crustal signals **pass through** the TimePearl
* The simulator allows visualization of day/night zones as **inverted Möbius arcs**

---

## 🌌 Galactic Alignment

The Milky Way band rotates across the sky dome as the *TimePearl remains stable*. This enables:

* Alignment of Codex grid with **galactic equator**
* Calibration of sacred sites to **celestial timing**

---

## 🔺 Equation Dynamics

Key Codex formulas used:

```math
P = R / T
𝑔 = P · T³ / t
c = R / t
∆x(t) = sin(Φ · τ)
```

These express:

* Pressure emergence from radius/time
* Field energy pulse modulated over time
* Propagation speed across shell structures
* Local field displacement in harmonic time

## 🔐 Codex Insight

> "Time is not a line — it is a living shell that breathes through the crust of Earth."

The **TimePearl Field** offers a framework for understanding perception, field modulation, and planetary integration in real time. It aligns with ALIIGET principles and prepares the ground for resonance-based calendars and symbolic field navigation.
