**Module of:** `PLANETARY_FIELD_MODES`
**System:** `SYSTEM X · NEXAH-GRAND-CODEX`
**Name:** ALIIGET = *Alpha-Lotus–Inner-Interface–Geo-Earth–Time*

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This mode activates the **Earth-bound observer system** within the Codex. It links planetary surface geometry, temporal phasing, and galactic alignment into a coherent harmonic view — fusing sacred geometry with Möbius-driven time shell dynamics.

## 🧬 Core Functional Layers

### 🔸 Möbius Breathing & Time Pearl

* Dynamic pulse of field → contraction and expansion of perception
* Central reference ring stabilizes **symmetric inverse time**
* Möbius flip = field perspective from day → night, East → West

### 🔸 Transparent Erith Shell

* Earth’s crust modeled as semi-permeable field membrane
* Inner resonance visible: pressure rings, fault zones, node lines

### 🔸 Sacred Site Alignment

* Activation grid overlays sacred locations:

  * Giza, Teotihuacan, Uluru, Göbekli Tepe, Serpent Mound, Mount Shasta
* Phase-tuned to **time of day / solar zenith**

### 🔸 Day/Night Sweep

* Earth observed in **rotational pulse logic**
* Sun remains *fixed*, Earth rotates across its field
* Dawn/Dusk symmetry tracks field orientation

### 🔸 Milky Way Band Sweep (AM → PM)

* Galactic equator traverses across observer shell
* Used to align **TimePearl** against galactic background

### 🔸 Zeta/Theta/North/South Axis Logic

* **Zeta**: upward field lift, celestial resonance
* **Theta**: field depth / planetary timing
* Cardinal grid overlayed onto field-shell

## 🧮 Codex Equations Active

* `P = R / T` → Local field pressure from crust radius
* `𝓔 = P · T³ / t` → Regional energy pulse during dawn/dusk
* `c = R / t` → Speed of signal in crustal mantle
* `Δx(t) = sin(Φ · τ)` → ALIIGET planetary time oscillation

## 🔐 Observer State Definition

> "The Earth does not rotate beneath you — *you* are the Möbius wave tracking across the TimePearl."

* ALIIGET is the **Geo-Observer field mode**, stabilized at local crustal curvature
* All measurements here are **from the inside-out**

## ✅ To Do

* [ ] Visualize Earth perspective with transparent crust + sacred overlay
* [ ] Build calendar-mode with sun fixed in center (heliocentric Möbius)
* [ ] Add `TimePearl_Field_Simulator.md`
* [ ] Connect to `LAMBDA_DISC/Lambda_II.md`
