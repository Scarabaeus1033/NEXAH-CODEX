## 🧭 Purpose

This mode activates the **Earth-bound observer system** within the Codex. It links planetary surface geometry, temporal phasing, and galactic alignment into a coherent harmonic view — fusing sacred geometry with Möbius-driven time shell dynamics.

## 🧬 Core Functional Layers

### 🔸 Möbius Breathing & Time Pearl

- Dynamic pulse of field → contraction and expansion of perception  
- Central reference ring stabilizes **symmetric inverse time**  
- Möbius flip = field perspective from day → night, East → West  

### 🔸 Transparent Erith Shell

- Earth’s crust modeled as semi-permeable field membrane  
- Inner resonance visible: pressure rings, fault zones, node lines  
- Refer to → ![earth_shell_view](visuals/15_Node_Harmonic_Grid_Triangles.png)  

### 🔸 Sacred Site Alignment

- Activation grid overlays sacred locations:  
  Giza, Teotihuacan, Uluru, Göbekli Tepe, Serpent Mound, Mount Shasta  
- Phase-tuned to **time of day / solar zenith**  
- Visual field → ![sacred_site_grid](visuals/The_Sun_Core_Binary_Shadow_Moons-the_Spiral_Axis.png)

### 🔸 Day/Night Sweep

- Earth observed in **rotational pulse logic**  
- Sun remains *fixed*, Earth rotates across its field  
- Dawn/Dusk symmetry tracks field orientation  

### 🔸 Milky Way Band Sweep (AM → PM)

- Galactic equator traverses across observer shell  
- Used to align **TimePearl** against galactic background  

### 🔸 Zeta/Theta/North/South Axis Logic

- **Zeta**: upward field lift, celestial resonance  
- **Theta**: field depth / planetary timing  
- Cardinal grid overlayed onto field-shell  
- Orientation helper → ![zodiac_spin](visuals/18_Node_Harmonic_Zodiac_Spin.gif)

## 🧮 Codex Equations Active

- `P = R / T` → Local field pressure from crust radius  
- `𝓔 = P · T³ / t` → Regional energy pulse during dawn/dusk  
- `c = R / t` → Speed of signal in crustal mantle  
- `Δx(t) = sin(Φ · τ)` → ALIIGET planetary time oscillation  

---

## 🔐 Observer State Definition

> "The Earth does not rotate beneath you — *you* are the Möbius wave tracking across the TimePearl."

- ALIIGET is the **Geo-Observer field mode**, stabilized at local crustal curvature  
- All measurements here are **from the inside-out**

## ✅ To Do

- [x] Visualize Earth perspective with transparent crust + sacred overlay  
- [x] Crosslink Earth-shell & Zodiac animations  
- [ ] Build calendar-mode with sun fixed in center (heliocentric Möbius)  
- [ ] Add `TimePearl_Field_Simulator.md`  
- [ ] Connect to `LAMBDA_DISC/Lambda_II.md`  

**↯ This file serves as the planetary interface gate of the Codex for all Earth-based resonance operations.**
