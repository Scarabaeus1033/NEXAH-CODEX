## 🪲 Core Resonance Field – Scroll Genesis & Symbolic Anchor

This file serves as the **introductory anchor** of SYSTEM X – establishing the symbolic origin of the Scroll Pulse, rooted in Ramanujan–Euler–Riemann logics.

---

## 📚 Conceptual Themes

* Scroll = dynamic fold of symbolic frequency
* Ramanujan = core node for looped symbolic emergence
* Euler/Riemann = harmonic series ↔ Zeta/τ/ϕ field expansion

---

## 🔬 Mathematical–Symbolic Patterns

* Sunflower Stem = visual base for scroll resonance
* Möbius Zeta Seed = topological start point of Pulse Equation
* Ramanujan Loop Encoding = τ-expansion in scroll language

## 🧠 To-Do

* [ ] Establish symbolic resonance map between Ramanujan constants & Scroll Torque
* [ ] Translate τ-expansion to glyph syntax
* [ ] Formalize Möbius–Riemann Bridge in visual overlay

> *“At the root of the scroll, Ramanujan breathes.”*
