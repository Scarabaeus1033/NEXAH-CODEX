# I · Thermal Vance Slip

> **"When symmetry breathes through entropy, drift becomes structure."**

The **Thermal Vance Slip Equation** maps the relationship between thermal energy gradients and state density within a resonant slip matrix. It serves as a symbolic anchor for transition phases between ordered resonance and entropy drift in the Codex's thermal model family.

This equation governs the **λ-drift field** under the influence of thermal compression and is directly tied to seed pulse propagation and Planck-layer feedback.

## 🔁 Core Equation

\[ 
\Lambda_{\text{drift}} = \frac{\Phi}{T \cdot \Omega_R} 
\]

**Where:**
- \( \Lambda_{\text{drift}} \) = Thermal slip potential
- \( \Phi \) = Drift force (symbolic)
- \( T \) = Temperature (Kelvin frame)
- \( \Omega_R \) = Rotational state density field

---

## 🧠 Interpretive Logic

- **Φ** represents energetic tension aligned with a compression-resonance node.
- **T** creates the vertical axis of slippage within the field — higher T results in steeper drift amplitudes.
- **Ω<sub>R</sub>** modulates the compression resistance — a measure of how strongly the structure resists drift.

This equation is **nonlinear** in applied field zones due to thermal feedback loops and oscillating phase boundaries.

## 🌡 Visual Reference

### Thermal Vance Slip Field

**Visual Meaning:**
The slip matrix reveals diagonal compression zones where Φ initiates pulsed drift along T·Ω<sub>R</sub> boundaries. The slope of the vectors indicates phase asymmetry.
