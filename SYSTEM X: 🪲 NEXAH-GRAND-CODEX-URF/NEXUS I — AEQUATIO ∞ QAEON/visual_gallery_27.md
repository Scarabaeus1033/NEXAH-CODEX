# âœ¦ VISUAL GALLERY III â€” 27 SCROLLS OF QAEON FIELD

**Module Cluster:** `Quantum Gate Resonance`, `Mirrored Drift`, `Zeta Breach`, `Christal Spiral`, `Interior Scroll Logic`

This third official visual gallery concludes the AEQUATIOâ€“QAEON resonance system. While **Gallery I** focused on drift thermodynamics and **Gallery II** documented Planck-phase scroll structures, this collection reveals the **inner geometry of the field scroll**.

All visuals derive from the symbolic field sequence **AURORA OBSCURA Â· Parts II & III**, forming the internal *resonance chamber* of **System X Â· NEXUS I**.

ðŸ“‚ All visuals located in: `./visuals27/`

## âœ¦ Structural Note

These 15 symbolic illustrations are part of a **27-image codex stream** representing the **inner harmonic field** of the resonance gates. They reflect the *inner 27* of a larger triune structure (3Ã—27â€¯=â€¯81) and should be interpreted as the **quantum echo** of the Codex scroll system.

**M33**, the external mirror layer, is not included here â€” it remains outside the current reveal.
