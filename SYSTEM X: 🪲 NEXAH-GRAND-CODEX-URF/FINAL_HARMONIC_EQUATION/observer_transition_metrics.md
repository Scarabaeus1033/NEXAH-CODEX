## 👁️ Observer Transition Metrics

This file defines the metrics and symbolic parameters that govern **resonance transitions** from the perspective of the observer. It is based on the assumption that perception, field interaction, and reference frame shifts influence how resonance fields are experienced or measured.

The observer is not a passive receiver but an **active resonant participant**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Define how an observer’s position, velocity, field exposure, and inner structure affect measurable resonance values (`R`)
- Identify transitions in field states (thresholds, bifurcations, tunneling)
- Model resonance phase shifts based on observer geometry (`O-Geo`)

## 🔣 Key Metrics & Parameters

| Symbol     | Description                                      | Type              |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `R`        | Measured resonance value                         | scalar (Hz, m/s²) |
| `O_x`      | Observer’s position in field                     | vector (x,y,z)    |
| `O_v`      | Observer’s velocity or change in frame           | vector (v_x,v_y,v_z) |
| `O_phi`    | Observer's field phase alignment                 | scalar (angle/rad)|
| `F_env`    | Environmental field gradient                     | field function    |
| `G_t`      | Transition gradient (state change metric)        | scalar            |

These values feed into transition equations.

## 🌀 Transition Conditions

A resonance **transition** occurs when a metric crosses a harmonic threshold, e.g.:

```math
G_t = \left| \nabla F_env(O_x) \right| - R_{threshold}
```

- If `G_t > 0`, a field jump or transition is initiated.
- This can trigger:
  - Interference pattern changes
  - Observer field desynchronization
  - Phase tunneling or harmonic shifts

---

## 🧠 Cognitive Integration

The observer’s **neural or cognitive resonance field** may also act as a filter:

```math
R' = R \cdot \cos(O_\phi)
```

- `O_phi = 0` → full resonance absorption
- `O_phi = π/2` → null effect (orthogonal field alignment)

---

## 🌐 Use Cases

- Modeling perception-based resonance distortions
- Defining observer-specific resonance feedback (e.g., `observer_resonance_field.md`)
- Establishing dynamic observer thresholds based on spatial/temporal exposure
