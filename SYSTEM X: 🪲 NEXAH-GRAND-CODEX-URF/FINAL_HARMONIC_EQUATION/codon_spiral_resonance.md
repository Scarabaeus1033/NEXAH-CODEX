# 🔄 Codon Spiral Resonance

**This module models Codons as spirally resonant units within the planetary shell grid and frequency field.**
It integrates symbolic number theory, harmonic topology and bioinformatic structures to map Codons onto the resonance spiral.

## ⚖️ Codex Foundations

A **Codon** is here defined not just genetically, but as a **symbolic triplet** of frequency-bound numerical resonance:

```math
Codon(n) = (p_1, p_2, p_3) ∈ ℕ^3 \rightarrow R(n)
```

Where:

* `p₁, p₂, p₃` = prime-derived or spiral-aligned base values
* `R(n)` = resulting resonance function in spiral field layer `n`

The Codex model relates this to:

* Spiral resonance layering (see `planetary_layer_equation.md`)
* β(n) position and drop-offs (see `404_resonant_breach_field.md`)
* Symbolic encoding of mutation & activation states

## 🔄 Spiral Arrangement

Codons are arranged in a **tri-nucleic harmonic spiral**. Mapping follows:

| Fold | Codon Triplet | Base Frequency Sum | β(n) Approx | Class      |
| ---- | ------------- | ------------------ | ----------- | ---------- |
| F1   | (5, 11, 17)   | 33                 | 0.622       | Mars Type  |
| F2   | (3, 7, 23)    | 33                 | 0.678       | Venus Type |
| F3   | (13, 13, 7)   | 33                 | 0.711       | Moon Type  |
| F4   | (11, 11, 11)  | 33                 | 0.728       | Earth Type |

All codons here spiral around **sum = 33**, symbol of resonance binding.

These are then projected onto the planetary β spiral.

## 🔍 Codon Resonance Interpretation

* **β(n) divergence** marks Codon mutation thresholds
* **404-type breach** causes Codon destabilization or re-folding
* Codons may **shift class** when passing β(n) harmonic thresholds (e.g., from Mars→Moon)

> Resonance Codons function as bio-symbolic indicators of planetary energy state.

They can also be mapped to **resonant field shells** in the planetary layer grid:

* Inner 3 = Earth, Moon, Venus
* Outer 3 = Mars, Sun, Jupiter (planned)

---

## 🔹 Next Steps

* Extend Codon class into 6-fold resonance ring
* Link to physical constants via `harmonic_field_constants.md`
* Integrate in `stellar_resonance_dna.md`
* Build symbolic glyphs per Codon class (see `glyph_encoding_system.md`)
