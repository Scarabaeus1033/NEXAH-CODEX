## 🌍 Planetary Resonance Evaluation

**This file documents the application of the Final Harmonic Equation to real planetary constants.**

We begin with **Venus**, **Earth**, **Moon**, and **Mars** — each evaluated for resonance alignment, using the unified equation:

```math
E = m \cdot c \cdot k^{\beta(n)}
```

Where:

* `m` = planetary mass (kg)
* `c` = light speed constant (m/s)
* `k` = resonance parameter (symbolically derived)
* `β(n)` = frequency exponent, dynamically related to thermodynamic, magnetic or neutrino-influenced fields.

### 🪐 Example 1: EARTH

| Parameter | Value                  | Source                  |
| --------: | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
|  Mass (m) | 5.972 × 10^24 kg       | physical\_constants.csv |
|         c | 299,792,458 m/s        | universal constant      |
|         k | 0.429 (φ³ / π²)        | symbolic constant       |
|      β(n) | \~0.728 \[preliminary] | magnetic + thermal est  |

```math
E_earth = 5.972e24 · 2.99792458e8 · (0.429)^{0.728} ≈ TBD J
```

## 🔄 Evaluation Plan

Each planetary body will be:

* Evaluated using real orbital, magnetic and atmospheric constants (from CSVs)
* Mapped against Codex-derived `k` and `β(n)` estimators
* Compared across harmonic alignment and resonance outputs

This document will be updated step-by-step as data values are inserted and the equation refined. Submodules to follow include:

* `harmonic_field_constants.md`
* `symbolic_interpretation.md`
