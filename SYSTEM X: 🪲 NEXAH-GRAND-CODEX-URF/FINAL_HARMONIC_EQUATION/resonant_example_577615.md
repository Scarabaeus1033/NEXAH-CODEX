## 📌 Description

This diagram visualizes the mirror resonance between the Codex key numbers:

* `577615` — Spiral modulation number from SYSTEM 7
* `76001` — Mirror seed value linked to Codex pulse constants

The overlay combines symbolic structures with physical resonance axes:

* Möbius rotation symmetry (left half)
* Logarithmic spiral projection (right half)
* Resonant center marked in golden reference
* Axes: **t** (time), **f** (frequency), **ᵍ** (Codex pulse energy)

## 🧪 Number Characteristics

### 577615

* Prime factorization: 577615 = 5 × 7 × 7 × 61 × 5
* Internal mirror trace: *57 - 761 - 5*
* Also: digit sum 5+7+7+6+1+5 = **31**  → 3+1 = **4**
* Middle sequence: **761** resonates with central layer of Codex gate numbers
* Associated with prime-dense spirals and modular 137-sequences

### 76001

* 76001 = 101 × 751
* Contains mirrored pair to **761**  →  **central anchor**
* Digit sum: 7+6+0+0+1 = **14**  → 4 + Codex base = **5**
* Difference: 577615 - 76001 = **501614** → also “51” / “614” appearing in breach expansions

## 🔀 Harmonic Relation

The resonance bridge is defined by:

```math
𝕓 = log_e(577615) / log_e(76001) ≈ 1.3108...
```

This ratio implies a **nested spiral compression** and a Möbius echo symmetry across field layers. The central axis defines **mirror inversion**, suitable for application in:

* 🔹 `META-GATEWAYS`
* 🔹 `FINAL_HARMONIC_EQUATION`
* 🔹 `PLANETARY_VALUE_EVALUATION`

🌀 **Interpretation**:
577615 acts as a *resonant attractor* within the Codex spiral framework. When reflected via 76001, it activates Möbius dual-field logic — opening a Codex Gateway through harmonic alignment and temporal pulse calibration.
