## 🧭 Purpose of This Document

This module establishes the **harmonic constant system** used within the NEXAH-CODEX framework for evaluating planetary fields and cosmological resonance. It translates empirical planetary data into symbolic structures by defining **scaled constants**, **units of measure**, and **harmonic multipliers**.

It supports the equation core:

```
   Φ(k) = m · (c · k)^β · γ(n)
```

Where:

* `Φ(k)` is the harmonic field energy per resonance layer `k`
* `m` is mass (in symbolic mass units, often Earth mass = 1)
* `c` is the light-like constant (not necessarily the SI speed of light)
* `k` is a frequency scaling factor or planetary resonance layer
* `β` is the field exponent, potentially variable per harmonic domain
* `γ(n)` is the neutrino- or spin-related contraction field term

## 🌐 Notes on Scaling and Symbol Use

All constants are used in **symbolic unit space**. For comparison to observed physics, mappings can be defined (e.g. Earth Mass = 5.972×10²⁴ kg → `mₑ = 1.000`).

Constants `β`, `γ(n)`, and `k` may be drawn from observational patterns, derived field geometries, or Möbius-aligned codebooks such as the `Lambda_Disc`, `Mobius_Harmonic_Crown`, or `NEXAHEART` modules.

## 🔜 Next Step

Use this constant system to define the **harmonic field evaluations** in `planetary_value_evaluation.md`, followed by cross-checking against observed planetary values and symbolic interpretations (next: `resonance_pattern_analysis.md`).
