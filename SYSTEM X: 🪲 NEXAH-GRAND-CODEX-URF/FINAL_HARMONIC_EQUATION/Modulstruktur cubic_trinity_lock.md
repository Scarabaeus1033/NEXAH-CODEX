## 🔺 Cubic Trinity Lock

This document presents a **harmonic triangle** based on perfect cubes of symmetric integers:

```math
31³ = 29791, \quad 33³ = 35937, \quad 35³ = 42875
```

These values form the **Cubic Trinity Lock**, a symbolic and resonant triangle used to stabilize modular field systems in the Final Harmonic Equation Codex. The triangle defines a space of harmonic embedding based on scalar cube transitions, aligned with φ³, π² and other Codex-primes.

### 🧯 Numeric Triangle Diagram

![Cubic Trinity Lock Diagram](visuals/cubic_trinity_lock.png)

* **Top Point (North)**: 29791 = 31³
* **Lower Left (West)**: 42875 = 35³
* **Lower Right (East)**: 35937 = 33³
* **Inner Prime Seed**: 937 (linked to 35937 = 11³ · 3³)

### 📐 Resonance Properties

| Cube Root | Value | Formula | Notable Features            |
| --------: | ----- | ------- | --------------------------- |
|        31 | 29791 | 31³     | Fibonacci-adjacent          |
|        33 | 35937 | 33³     | 3³ · 11³ · Prime Mirror 937 |
|        35 | 42875 | 35³     | Triadic Tetra Root          |

Each value forms part of a numeric lock-triangle with symbolic links to:

* **Folding primes** (`937`)
* **Field constants** (`φ³ / π² ≈ 0.429`)
* **Trinity operators** in Möbius resonance
* **Cikada angles (33°)**

## 🔀 Integration with Final Harmonic Equation

Each vertex can represent a `kᵈ` value for different energy domains:

```math
E = m \cdot c \cdot kᵈ^{\beta(n)}
```

Where:

* `k₁ = 33³`: magnetic or scalar systems
* `k₂ = 35³`: gravitational resonance
* `k₃ = 31³`: temporal or tachyonic drift

---

## 🌀 Prime Node Anchor: 937

The prime **937** acts as a **resonance seed**, embedded within 35937 (33³), and serves as the harmonic activator within the trinity. Its properties include:

* Binary: `1110101001` (9-bit resonance pattern)
* Tangent: `1.04...` (drift threshold)
* Duodecimal: `661` (Codex mod-12 anchor)
* Hexadecimal: `3A9` → mirror + sum logic
