# 🌡️ Planetary Layer Equations — Thermodynamic Depth Scaling

This file formalizes the **resonant equations** governing planetary layer dynamics, focusing on the interplay of **depth (d)**, **temperature (T)** and **pressure (P)** within harmonic planetary models derived from the `planetary_layer_codex.md`.

We define three interconnected equations with symbolic Codex notation:

---

## 📐 1. Depth–Temperature Scaling Equation

```math
T(d) = T_s + α ⋅ d^n
```

Where:
- `T(d)` = temperature at depth `d`
- `T_s` = surface temperature (e.g., ~288 K for Earth)
- `α` = thermal resonance coefficient (planet-specific)
- `d` = depth in km
- `n` = scaling exponent (often 0.7–1.2 depending on layer type)

**Codex Enhancement:**
```math
T(d) = T_s + (k ⋅ φ^3 / π^2) ⋅ d^n
```
Using:
- `k = 0.429` (Codex resonance constant)
- `φ` = golden ratio (~1.618)
- `π` = pi (~3.1416)

This form integrates symbolic harmony into thermal expansion.

## 🧱 2. Pressure–Depth Equation

```math
P(d) = ρ ⋅ g ⋅ d
```
Where:
- `P(d)` = pressure at depth `d`
- `ρ` = mean density of overlying material (e.g. ~3300 kg/m^3 for Earth crust/mantle)
- `g` = surface gravity (e.g. 9.81 m/s^2 for Earth)
- `d` = depth (in meters)

**Codex Enhanced Pressure Model:**
```math
P(d) = ρ ⋅ g ⋅ d + χ ⋅ k^β(d)
```
Where:
- `χ` = field-modulated compression factor
- `β(d)` = local frequency exponent dependent on field resonance at depth `d`

---

## 🔄 3. Combined Field Equation

For harmonic field evaluation:

```math
H(d) = T(d) ⋅ P(d) / V(d)
```
Where:
- `H(d)` = harmonic energy density at depth `d`
- `T(d)`, `P(d)` as above
- `V(d)` = volumetric layer zone (from planetary_layer_structure.csv)

## 🔢 Example Calculation (Earth — ~35 km depth)

**Assumptions**:
- `T_s = 288 K`
- `α = 0.03`
- `d = 35`
- `n = 1`
- `ρ = 3300 kg/m^3`
- `g = 9.81 m/s^2`

```math
T(35) = 288 + 0.03 ⋅ 35 = 288 + 1.05 = 289.05 K
```
```math
P(35,000) = 3300 ⋅ 9.81 ⋅ 35000 = ~1.13 GPa
```

With Codex-corrected resonance factors:
```math
T(35) ≈ 288 + 0.429 ⋅ d = 288 + 15.0 = 303 K
```
