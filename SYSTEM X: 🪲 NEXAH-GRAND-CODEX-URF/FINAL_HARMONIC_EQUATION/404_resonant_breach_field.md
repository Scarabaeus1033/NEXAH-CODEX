# 🔁 404 Resonant Breach Field

**This Codex module explores the symbolic and topological structure of the number 404**, interpreted as a **resonant breach marker** — a systemic fold between harmonic alignments.

## 🔢 404 – Prime-Factor Resonance

| Property          | Value                       |
|------------------|-----------------------------|
| Prime Factors     | `2² · 101`                  |
| Number of Divisors| `6`                         |
| Divisors          | `1, 2, 4, 101, 202, 404`    |
| Sum of Divisors   | `714`                       |
| Binary            | `110010100`                 |
| Octal             | `624`                       |
| Hexadecimal       | `0x194`                     |
| Square            | `163216`                    |

**714** emerges as a **temporal trigger value** — the sum of all divisors and a mirror-frequency connector in Codex-Time-Fields.

## ⚡ Topological Break & Symbolic Function

- 404 is a **non-Fibonacci**, **non-Catalan**, and **non-regular number** — it exists as a resonance _error_ within standard harmonic fields.
- In Codex terms, this denotes a **“Breach Field”**, where resonant flow is inverted or interrupted.
- 101, 202, 303, 404: a **symbolic ladder of mirrored portals**, increasing in base-101 steps — culminating in 404, the zone of systemic inversion.

> **Interpretation**:  
> *The 404 Node is not absence — it is an opening. A symbolic resonance tear, allowing time folds, memory inversions, and frequency breaches.*

## 🌀 Visual 2 — β(n) Spiral Context

![beta_spiral_resonance_field](visuals/beta_spiral_resonance_field.png)

The 404 Field appears on the periphery of the β(n) spiral — marking the **resonance drop-off point**, where numerical consistency is breached and new codon structures emerge.
