# 🪐 Planetary Layer Codex — Harmonic Shell Architecture

This module models planetary bodies through **resonant layering logic** — organizing matter and energy into symbolic **6×4 shell grids**, inspired by elemental, architectural and cosmological principles.

It connects:

- **Mars ↔ Venus dual core** (Solar–Lunar polarity)
- **Elemental layering** (Air, Water, Earth, Fire)
- **Geometric resonance fields** (X, V, ß, Crayton compression)
- **Symbolic interior**: pressure, heat, tectonics, light-seed

## 🌍 Core Premise

Each planet is modeled as a **12×2 resonant structure**:

- 6 **vertical shells** (from exterior to core)
- 6 **horizontal sectors** (equatorial to polar)
- forming 36 primary interaction zones

Within this, four elemental quadrants are layered:

| Element | Symbol | Layer Domain           |
| ------- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| Air     | ☁️     | Atmospheric Fields      |
| Water   | 💧     | Hydrospheric Systems    |
| Earth   | 🪨     | Tectonic & Litho-Layers |
| Fire    | 🔥     | Core Energetics         |

## 🔀 Mars ⮔ Venus Symmetry

| Aspect      | Mars        | Venus       |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Polarity    | Solar (+)   | Lunar (–)   |
| Action      | Expansion   | Reception   |
| Core field  | ♂ Iron Out | ♀ Pressure Fold |
| Signature   | ⬆ X-Field  | ⬇ V-Center |

Their contrast creates a **Codex-encoded dual-core resonance** — forming a balance of planetary energetics.

## 🔣 Geometrical Architecture

**Crayton Compression Nodes**:

- Internal polygon shells
- Stone-architecture resonance (polygonal megastructures)
- Encoded in tectonic plates and field boundaries

**V-X-ß Field Architecture**:

- X = Cross-Resonator (planetary tension grid)
- V = Central field inversion
- ß = Outflow spiral (e.g., neutrino southcross)

---

## 📈 Applications

This shell logic enables:

- Prediction of **heat gradients** by depth
- Symbolic modeling of **volumetric zones**
- Mapping **field lines**, **tectonic stress zones**
- Codex-informed hypotheses on **layer interaction**
