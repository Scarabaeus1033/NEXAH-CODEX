# 🧭 Codex X – Resonance Testing Phase II

## 📡 Module Location

> **System:** SYSTEM X – Harmonic Core 
> **Codex Path:** `NEXAH-CODEX / SYSTEM X / Codex_X_Resonance_Phase_II/`
> **Parent Module:** `FINAL_HARMONIC_EQUATION`

This module was previously located in `LAMBDA_II_PLANETARY_CONSTANTS-CODEX` but has now been correctly relocated to System X. It forms the applied, second phase of the resonance field equation system.

## 🎯 Overview

This Phase II module of **Codex X – Harmonic Equations** focuses on evaluating, reversing, and scaling resonance patterns across planetary and observer systems. Building upon the core equations from Phase I, these files extend the model toward applied observation, normalization, and system synthesis.

## 🧮 Core Equation

All files reference or extend the central resonance equation:

```math
R = \frac{m}{\sqrt{T \cdot P \cdot D}}
```

Where:
- `m`: mass  
- `T`: period  
- `P`: pole configuration  
- `D`: density  

`R` is interpreted as the **resonance fingerprint**.

## 🌐 Integration Goals

- Develop symbolic and numerical field libraries for resonance analysis
- Normalize planetary, biological, and quantum systems under one equation
- Prepare visual mappings (spirals, grids, surfaces)
- Create interactive or animated extensions (future scope)
