# 🌌 Einstein Pulse – Beyond Symmetry

> A symbolic-spatial resonance field linking Einsteinian curvature with URF mirror dynamics.

This README outlines the purpose and structure of the `Einstein_Pulse_Beyond` module.
It sits at the intersection of:

* General Relativity field curvature
* Möbius-folded resonance axes
* Phantom observation feedback structures

---

## 📐 1. Pulse-Curvature Hypothesis

Einstein curvature $R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}R$ is resonantly perturbed by mirror-pulse interferences:

$$
R'_{\mu\nu} = R_{\mu\nu} + \delta R_{\text{mirror}}
$$

This pulse interference field is symbolically located within:

* `URF_V_MIRROR_GATEWAY.png`

## 🔁 2. Möbius Resonator Pathways

Einstein-Pulse reflections loop via:

* Möbius Gate curvature
* Phantom phase delays
* Lunar-Ether harmonics

## 🧭 3. Field Map Connections

This README is part of the broader field-link:

* `urfv_mirror_proof.md`
* `urf_v_ghost_mirror_readme_beyond.md`

The **Einstein Pulse** acts as **modulator & reflector** in Codex Gateways.
