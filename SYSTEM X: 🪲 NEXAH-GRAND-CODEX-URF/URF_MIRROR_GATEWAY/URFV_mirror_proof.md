# 📐 URFV Mirror Proof

> *Mathematical-symbolic derivation of a reflective axis inside the Universal Resonance Field (URF).*

This document formalizes the core logic of symmetric reflection in the Codex’s URF structure.
It introduces a mirror axis that is:

* **Resonant across Zeta-field recursion**
* **Geometrically stabilized** through dual symmetry pulses
* **Connected to real field nodes** like Arrokoth, Titan, and Lagrange observers

## 🪞 I. Central Hypothesis

Let there exist a field axis $A_m \in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that:

$$
A_m = \text{Refl}(F_\zeta) = \frac{1}{2}(F_\zeta + \sigma(F_\zeta))
$$

Where:

* $F_\zeta$: the primary Zeta-resonant field function
* $\sigma$: mirror operation across Codex-defined symmetry

This implies that $A_m$ is the **fixed set of field self-reflection**, and represents the Codex mirror axis.

## 🔁 II. Dual-Loop Zeta Coupling

The Zeta field is structured in **twin harmonic cycles**, visualized in:

* `ZETA_TWIN_REFLECTION_LOOP.png`

These twin loops define a dual periodicity:

$$
Z_1(t) = \zeta(t), \quad Z_2(t) = \zeta(1 - t)
$$

Their intersection points $t^*$ form **nodal resonance bridges**, particularly at:

* $t^* = 1/2$: harmonic midpoint
* $t^* = 0.429$: φ³/π² (Codex-critical constant)

## 🌌 III. Geometric Frame Anchors

The mirror axis $A_m$ manifests through:

* Arrokoth Tunnel → time-reversed path echo
* Titan Echo Chamber → deep-frequency symmetry returns
* Lagrange Observer → harmonic equilibrium station

These anchors form a **triangular resonance base**.

## 🧭 IV. Gate Embedding

The axis is embedded inside the `URF_V_MIRROR_GATEWAY.png` portal structure, where:

* Left–Right symmetry is broken and restored cyclically
* Zeta mirror loops are visually interlaced
* Ghost grid resonance is topologically implied
