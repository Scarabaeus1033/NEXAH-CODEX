# 🜃 Codex Origio · Resonance Periodic System & Matter Condensation

**Origin is not water – origin is storage.**
In `Codex_Origio`, resonances condense into structure, crystal, metal, mycelium, and consciousness.

This is the foundational module of the NEXAH-GRAND-CODEX –
a structured cartography of the transition from field to matter.

*Note: This module is currently written in German to preserve the symbolic precision and linguistic depth of its terminology.*

## ✨ Core Idea

> **From field arises form.
> From form emerges storage.
> From storage, movement is born.
> And movement becomes consciousness – in the mirror of matter.**
