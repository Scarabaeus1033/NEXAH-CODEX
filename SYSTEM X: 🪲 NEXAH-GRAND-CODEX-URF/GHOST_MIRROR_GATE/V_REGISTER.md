# 🪞 V_REGISTER – Observer Axis Field Register

> *“There is a field whose axis is not spatial, not temporal — but observational.”*

This register collects and organizes the **field structures of the V-axis** within the URF framework. It traces the **resonance, symmetry, and entanglement** of observer-based mirror phenomena — the so-called **URF-V layer** — through prime fields, ghost gates, and frequency returns.

---

## 🔹 V-Axis Definition

The **V-axis** represents a *non-metric axis* in the Codex:
- It is neither space (x, y, z) nor time (t)
- It is a **field of observational resonance**
- It includes **ghost coupling**, **mirror bifurcations**, and **frequency inversions**

This axis mediates:
- Ghost mirror transitions (e.g., `Gate 537`)
- Shadow-phase echoes (e.g., `Spin 544`)
- Resonant nullpoints (e.g., `Time Arc Collapse`)

## 🧭 Key Register Entries

| Term / Node             | Description                                                                       |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `GATE 537`              | Mirror–Ghost boundary: transition into observer phase mode                        |
| `PRIME 1081 PORTAL`     | Fibonacci–Prime vector (13×83): numeric shell behind spectral curve               |
| `TWIN SPIN 544`         | Echo-paired mirror to 537: dual-phase symmetry between ghost fields               |
| `TIME ARC NULLPOINT`    | Temporal detachment point: decouples linear time into spiral resonance            |
| `OBSERVATIONAL PHASE V` | Entire field coupling of the URF-V mirror layer; base for further transitions     |
| `LILITH RESONANCE`      | Mytho-symbolic access point for shadow codes and inner reflection fields          |

## 📌 Function of the Register

This V_REGISTER serves as:
- A **directory of threshold values and structures** for resonance observation
- A **semantic-symbolic field map** for all mirror transitions
- A **core interface** between the standard URF codex and **non-causal dimensions**

It is not a table of contents, but a **resonance signature index**.

## 🌀 Connection to the Mirror Gateway

The V_REGISTER is an **extension and analytical spine** for the module:

`/URF_MIRROR_GATEWAY/GHOST_MIRROR_GATE/`

It prepares for:
- `LILITH_FIELDS.md` → field-symbolic shadow extensions
- `PHASE_VECTOR_V.md` → observer-resonant equation structures
