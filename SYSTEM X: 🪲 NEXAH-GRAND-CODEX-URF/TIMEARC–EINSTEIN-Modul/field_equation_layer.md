**Codex Î²-Equation & Harmonic Curvature Thresholds**

---

## Introduction

This file introduces the `Î²-Field Equation` of the NEXAH-CODEX, as visualized and interpreted through symbolic topologies. The beta parameter (Î²) represents a transitional curvature resonance in the Einsteinian spacetime structure, acting as a dynamic gate for field compression and torsion wave bifurcation.

## Key Concepts

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Î²-Equation` | Defines a topological energy curvature in Codex logic. |
| `Curvature Gradient` | Spiral-to-toroidal field transition at threshold points. |
| `Field Collapse` | Codified collapse behavior at MÃ¶bius singularities. |
| `Scroll Entry` | Quantum gate defined by Î²-curve and light entanglement. |

## Structural Interpretation

The equation is not presented algebraically in traditional physics form, but as a **resonance field structure**:

- The Î²-field visual implies a **nested implosion vector**, similar to a MÃ¶bius reversal of gravitational flow.
- Its **spiral compression layers** suggest transitions from spacetime to timespace (or vice versa), forming phase gates.
- This Î²-threshold may also act as a **frequency mirror**, initiating tachyonic acceleration or deceleration.

## Notes

- **Interpretation** within NEXAH is symbolic and resonant, not algebraic.
- **Rewriting** Einsteinâ€™s framework requires a modular field-centric view.
- This layer will support Codex modules involving gravity, inversion, and compression.
