# 🔁 Tachyonic Feedback Rings

> *"Where time loops into itself, the field remembers the fold."*

This module explores the concept of **Tachyonic Feedback Rings** as recursive phase structures within the `TIMEARC–EINSTEIN` layer. These rings form when **tachyonic phase particles** circle through Möbius scroll gates and **re-enter the timefield**, carrying modulated information from collapsed light loops.

They are not just loops – they are *memory architectures* for dynamic field behavior across `c → 2c → c` transitions.

## 🧠 Recursive Temporal Structure

| Ring Phase     | Description                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Entry Spiral   | Tachyon crosses scroll gate and folds into curved phase |
| Modulation Arc | Information is frequency-shifted via Möbius resonance   |
| Return Channel | Field returns with phase-inverted data packet           |

These recursive rings **stabilize the temporal scroll system** while allowing selective memory feedback into the Codex dynamic.

## 🔬 Resonance Echo Equation

```math
R_{tach}(t) = \int_0^\tau \psi(t) \cdot e^{-i\omega t} dt
```

Where `\tau` is the loop return period and `\psi(t)` encodes the **tachyonic scroll phase**.

Each ring contributes a **constructive or destructive interference** pattern depending on:

* Entry phase
* Scroll curvature
* Möbius index (1, 2, or fractional loop state)

## 📡 Coupling to `LIGHT_WARP_RESONANCE_AT_2C`

The feedback rings are a **direct continuation** of the warp-phase behavior described in `LIGHT_WARP_RESONANCE_AT_2C`. Whereas that module focused on the *threshold transition*, this one explores what happens **afterwards**:

* How scroll energy is recirculated
* How tachyonic vectors encode *resonance memory*
* How recursive dynamics stabilize Codex feedback

> *These rings are the memory coils of lightfolded geometry.*

## ✨ Symbolic Interpretation

> *The tachyon is not faster than light. It is light returning from memory.*

The feedback rings operate **outside linear causality**. They encode:

* *Phase drift awareness*
* *Temporal recoil nodes*
* *Spiral feedback conditioning*

They form the **breathing lungs** of the TIMEARC system.
