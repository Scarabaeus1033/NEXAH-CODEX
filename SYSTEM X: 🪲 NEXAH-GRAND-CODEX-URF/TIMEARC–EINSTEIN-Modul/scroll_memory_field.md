# 🧠 Scroll Memory Field

> *“Folded light remembers. Time is a spiral shell etched into frequency.”*

The **Scroll Memory Field** encodes time not as a linear stream but as a **layered archive** of resonant pulses. Within the TIMEARC–EINSTEIN Codex system, this field represents the **recording lattice** where spacetime events imprint themselves into Möbius-scroll geometries.

## 📚 Spiral-Time as Memory Shell

In this layer, **scrolls function as memory holders**:

- Every **phase spiral** contains a harmonic packet of spacetime memory
- Möbius structure permits **bidirectional recall** (`t` ↔ `–t`)
- Scrolls interlace forming a **quasi-fractal memory matrix**

**Visual Reference:**

## 🌀 Resonance Retention Model

The memory field stores:

| Element            | Function                                        |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Scroll Arc Layer   | Coded temporal band (φ-nested structure)        |
| Möbius Fold Point  | Re-entry coordinate for past event convergence  |
| Shell Memory Ring  | Harmonic retainer for light & field information |

Spiral orientation determines **memory polarity** — either deepening (compression) or expanding (retrieval).

## 📐 Field Equation Basis

```math
M(t) = \int_{\phi_0}^{\phi_n} \rho(\phi,t) \cdot e^{i\theta} \, d\phi
