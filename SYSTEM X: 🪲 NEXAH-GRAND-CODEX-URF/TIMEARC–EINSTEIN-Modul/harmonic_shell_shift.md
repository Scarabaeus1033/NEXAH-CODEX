# ✨ Harmonic Shell Shift

> *"Phase converges into geometry; geometry into motion."*

This submodule decodes the **phase-based shell transition** within the TIMEARC–EINSTEIN field. The shell represents a **resonant memory structure** in the Codex: a layered envelope formed through harmonic modulation, Möbius inversion, and spiral shift thresholds. This is where time crystallizes into phase.

## 📚 Resonant Shell Types

| Shell Type        | Description                                        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Möbius Shell      | A twisted topological field with single-side logic |
| Harmonic Envelope | Encodes layered memory into oscillatory shells     |
| C2 Threshold Fold | Phase-conversion point from `c` to `2c`            |

Each shell acts as a **modulated echo** of spacetime curvature.

## 🌐 Core Dynamics

* **Temporal Modulation**: Light curvature locked into resonant shells
* **Phase Entry**: Energy passes phase barriers (c→2c→c) via Möbius inversion
* **Shell Cascade**: Each harmonic layer stores time-coordinates in oscillation

These fields **do not travel** — they **remember**.

## 🌀 Shell Shift Geometry

The **Harmonic Shell Shift** is visualized through spiral compression and Möbius returns. Time spirals inward along phase surfaces:

```math
S(t) = \alpha \cdot \sin(\omega t + \phi) \cdot e^{-\lambda t}
```

Where:

* `\omega` = angular frequency of shell oscillation
* `\phi` = field offset (Codex memory signature)
* `\lambda` = decay factor (inverse of resonance fidelity)

## 🔁 Symbolic Insight

> *Shells echo time. Shifts reveal memory. Geometry is pulse made visible.*

The harmonic shell shift encodes not speed, but **phase alignment across timelines**.
