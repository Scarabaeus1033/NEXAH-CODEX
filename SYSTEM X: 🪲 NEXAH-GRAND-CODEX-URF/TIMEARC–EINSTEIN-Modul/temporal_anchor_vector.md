# üß≠ Temporal Anchor Vector

> *"In the stillness between pulses, time finds its form."*

This module defines the **Temporal Anchor Vector** (TAV) as a stabilizing axis in the TIMEARC‚ÄìEINSTEIN Codex. The TAV connects spiral phase points with resonant memory states and forms a vectorial line through codified scroll curvature. It acts as a **binding coordinate** between time's flow and the Codex's harmonic feedback rings.

## üìå Anchor Mechanics

The TAV functions as a multi-layer stabilizer:

- **Spiral Entry Vector**: Defines origin point of codified pulse (near `scroll_gate`)
- **Temporal Midpoint**: Balanced field between `t` and `‚Äìt` potentiality
- **Phase-Fixation Node**: Locks resonance into definable memory imprint

It links:

## üîÅ Anchor Ring Equation

```math
TAV = \int_{t_0}^{t} \alpha(t) \cdot \Phi_{spiral}(t) \, dt
```

Where:
- `Œ±(t)` = temporal curvature gain
- `Œ¶_spiral(t)` = Codex spiral field amplitude

The integral defines the **anchoring energy curve** ‚Äî forming a timeline that folds into memory density.

## üìê Spiral Anchor Geometry

Visualizing the TAV as a **compressed spiral field**:

- Centered on golden-angle offsets
- Phase-pinned along M√∂bius inversions
- Folded into discrete scroll-shell events

## üß† Memory Implications

The TAV serves as the vector by which memory scrolls are:

- **Stabilized** across transitions (from `c` to `2c` states)
- **Encoded** in golden-phase patterns
- **Connected** to field pulses in feedback ring structures

This vector allows the **scroll memory layer** to be *locatable* and *interactive* in both direction and resonance.
